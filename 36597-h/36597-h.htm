<p><a name = "start" id = "start">This text</a> uses UTF-8 (Unicode)
file encoding. If the apostrophes and quotation marks in this paragraph
appear as garbage, you may have an incompatible browser or unavailable
fonts. First, make sure that your browser’s “character set” or “file
encoding” is set to Unicode (UTF-8). You may also need to change the
default font.</p>

<p>A handful of words use less common diacritics:</p>

<p class = "inset">
macron (“long” mark): Tronhūus, pandecāke<br>
breve (“short” mark): căno</p>

<p>These are explained at the <a href = "#endnotes">end of the
e-text</a>, along with general notes on Norwegian names and words used
in the book.</p>

<p>Typographical errors are shown in the text with <ins class =
"correction" title = "like this">mouse-hover popups</ins>. Some
Norwegian words are <ins class = "norway" title =
"correct form of word">similarly marked</ins>.
The word “invisible” means that there is
an appropriately sized blank space, but the character itself is missing.
Some names are written differently in the List of Illustrations than
elsewhere in the text; these are not individually marked. Unless
otherwise noted, Norwegian terms&mdash;including those that are
obviously wrong&mdash;were printed as shown.</p>

<p>‘<i>A man is at all times entitled, or even called upon by occasion,
to speak, and write, and in all fit ways utter, what he has himself gone
through, and known, and got the mastery of; and in truth, at bottom,
there is nothing else that any man has a right to write of. For the
rest, one principle, I&nbsp;think, in whatever farther you write, may be
enough to guide you: that of standing rigorously by the fact, however
naked it look. Fact is eternal; all fiction is very transitory in
comparison. All men are interested in any man if he will speak the facts
of his life for them; his authentic experience, which corresponds, as
face with face, to that of all other sons of <ins class = "correction"

<h4><a name = "intro_history" id = "intro_history">HISTORY.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">‘Canadian</span> canoes are the only boats
that will do’ was our conclusion after a thorough inspection of every
existing species of boat, and long consultation with ‘Sambo’ of Eton
about a totally new variety, invented but fortunately <i>not</i>
patented by one of our number.</p>

<p>Our party consisted of three men, who shall be briefly described
here. First, ‘the Skipper,’ so called from his varied experience by land
and sea in all parts of the world, but especially in Norway, whither we
were now intending to go in search of trout, reindeer, and the
picturesque. The Skipper is lank and thin, looking as though he had
outgrown his strength in boyhood, and never summoned up pluck enough to
recover it again. His high cheek-bones and troubled expression give one
the idea of a man who cannot convince himself that life is a success,
which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page_xii" id = "page_xii">xii</a></span>
is perhaps pretty nearly the view he actually takes of existence.</p>

<p>Secondly, ‘Esau,’ who received this name in consequence of the many
points in which his character and history resemble that of the patriarch
who first rejoiced in it: for our Esau, like his prototype, is
‘a&nbsp;cunning hunter and man of the fjeld;’ and we are sure that if he
ever had such a thing as a birthright, he would willingly have sold it
for a mess of pottage. Esau is short and joyous, and is one of those
people who never indigest anything, but always look and always are in
perfect health and spirits. It is annoying to see a man eat things that
his fellow-creatures can not without suffering for it afterwards, but
Esau invariably does this at dinner, and comes down to breakfast next
morning with a provoking colour on his cheek and a hearty appetite. His
office in this expedition was that of Paymaster; not because he
possessed any qualifications for the post, but because the Skipper had
conclusively proved that such employment was too gross and mundane for
<i>his</i> ethereal soul, by constantly leaving the purse which
contained our united worldly wealth on any spot where he chanced to rest
himself, when he and Esau went to spy out the land two years before
this.</p>

<p>Lastly, ‘John,’ so called for no better reason than
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page_xiii" id = "page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
the fact that he had been christened Charles: he had never yet visited
the wilds of Scandinavia. John is an Irishman, whose motto in life is
‘dum vivimus vivamus:’ he is tall and straight, with a colossal light
moustache. He generally wears his hat slightly tilted forward over his
forehead when engaged in conversation; and the set of his clothes and
whole deportment convey an idea that he is longing to tell you the most
amusing story in the world in confidence. He is no gossip, and the
anecdotes of his countrymen, of which he has an inexhaustible supply
always ready, are merely imparted to his listeners from philanthropic
motives, and because he longs for others to share in the enjoyment which
he gleans from their mental dissection.</p>

<p>The general idea of the campaign was that the Skipper and Esau should
leave England in the early part of July; fish their way up a string of
lakes into the Jotunfjeld, getting there in time for the commencement of
the reindeer season; establish a camp somewhere; and then that John,
starting a month later, should join, and the three of us sojourn in that
land until we were tired thereof. How we accomplished this meritorious
design we have tried to relate in the following pages.</p>

<h4><a name = "intro_geog" id = "intro_geog">GEOGRAPHY.</a></h4>

<p>The map of Norway, apart from Sweden, presents an outline something
like a tadpole with a crooked irregular tail. The Jotunfjeld is an
extensive range of the highest mountains which are to be found in
Northern Europe: before 1820 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> they
were totally unexplored, and at the present time they are still
perfectly wild and desolate, their summits covered with eternal ice and
snow, and even their valleys uninhabited. That part of the Jotunfjeld
which we intended to make our goal and headquarters is situated about
the middle of the tadpole’s body, and nearly equidistant from Throndhjem
and Christiania.</p>


<h4><a name = "intro_lang" id = "intro_lang">LANGUAGES.</a></h4>

<p>It is customary when writing a book on any foreign country to scatter
broadcast in your descriptions words and phrases in the language of that
country, in order to show that you really have been there. We propose to
depart from this usage in the course of this work; but if at any time
the exigencies of narrative seem to demand the use of the foreign
tongue, we have little doubt that the English language will provide an
equivalent, which shall be inserted for the benefit of the
uninitiated.</p>

<h4><a name = "intro_math" id = "intro_math">MATHEMATICS.</a></h4>

<p>Foreigners have a curious prejudice which leads them to adopt
different systems of coinage and measurement from those in favour in
England. But shall a Briton pander to this prejudice by making any use
of their ridiculous figures? Decidedly not. What matters it to us that a
Norwegian land-mile contains seven of our miles, and a sea-mile four? we
speak only of the British mile. What care we that the Norwegian kröne is
worth about 13½<i>d.</i>? Shall that prevent us from always calling it a
shilling? Never! And shall the fact that it is divided into ten 10-öre
pieces (which are little nickel coins worth about five farthings each)
restrain us from alluding to them as the ‘threepenny bits’ which they so
much resemble? Not while life remains.</p>

<p>Some of the statements that will be found in these pages may strike
the reader as being, to say the least of it, improbable. We therefore
wish to explain that all the incidents of sport and travel are simple
facts, but that here and there is introduced some slight fiction which
is too obviously exaggerated to require any comment.</p>

<span class = "subhead">THE VOYAGE.</span></h3>


<h5>July 8.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">At</span> ten <span class =
"smallroman">P.M.</span> on the platform of the Hull station might have
been seen the disconsolate form of Esau, who had arrived there a few
minutes before. To him entered suddenly an express train, with that
haste which seems to be inseparable from the movements of express
trains, adorned as to the roof of one of its carriages by a Canadian
canoe. From that carriage emerged the lanky body of the Skipper, and
general joy ensued.</p>

<p>Then in the hotel the Skipper related his perilous adventures; how he
had crossed London in a four-wheeler with the canoe on the quarter-deck,
and himself surrounded by rods, guns, rugs, tents, and ground-sheets in
the hold, amid the shouts of ‘boat ahoy!’ from the volatile populace,
and jeers from all the cabs that they met (there are many cabs in
London); how the station-master at King’s Cross&mdash;may
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page2" id = "page2">2</a></span>
his shadow never be less!&mdash;had personally superintended the packing
of the canoe on a low carriage which he put on to the train specially;
and how the G.W. charged four times as much as the G.N. He had seen John
the day before, and on being asked to ‘wander about, and get some things
with him,’ the Skipper had replied that it was quite impossible, as his
time was occupied for the whole day: but when John said, ‘I&nbsp;wanted
your advice chiefly about flies, and a new rod that I am thinking of
buying,’ he replied, ‘Sir, I&nbsp;have nothing of the slightest
importance to do; my time is yours; name the moment, and place of
meeting, and I will be there.’ Then they twain had spent a happy day;
for decidedly the next best thing to using your own rod is buying one
for another man&mdash;at his expense.</p>

<p>Poor Esau had no charming experiences to relate: he was a little
depressed because an intelligent tyke at Doncaster had looked into the
horse-box in which his canoe was travelling, hoping no doubt to see some
high-mettled racer, and had asked if ‘yon thing were some new mak o’
a&nbsp;coffin.’</p>

<h5>July 9.&mdash;</h5>

<p>We walked about Hull and made a few last purchases. In the course of
our wanderings we chanced to come to a shop, in the window of which many
strawberries, large and luscious, were exposed for sale. We immediately
entered that shop without exchanging a word, and the Skipper said to the
proprietress, ‘This gentleman wants to buy a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page3" id = "page3">3</a></span>
quantity of strawberries for a school feast;’ while Esau remarked, as he
fastened on to the nearest and largest basket, ‘My friend has been
ordered to eat strawberries by his doctor.’ After this a scene ensued
over which it were best to draw a veil.</p>

<p>At six o’clock we were safely aboard the good ship ‘Angelo,’ and saw
our baggage stowed. It consisted of three huge boxes of provisions,
weighing more than 100 lbs. each, two portmanteaus, two smaller bags,
a&nbsp;tent, a&nbsp;large waggon-sheet intended to form another tent,
a&nbsp;bundle of rugs and blankets, a&nbsp;large can containing all
cooking utensils, four gun-cases, seven rods, a&nbsp;bundle of axes,
a&nbsp;spade and other necessary tools, and the canoes with small wheels
for road transport. Those wheels were the only things in the whole
outfit that turned out to be not absolutely necessary. We did use them,
but only once, and might have managed without them.</p>

<p>When the aforesaid was all on board, there did not appear to be much
room for anything else in the steamship ‘Angelo;’ registering 1,300
tons; yet this vast pile was destined to travel many miles over a
desperately rough country in the two little canoes.</p>

<p>We were warped out of dock about eight o’clock, and steamed down the
Humber with a west wind and a smooth sea. It was showery up to the
moment of our departure, but as Hull faded from our sight it became
fine, and with the shores of England we seemed to leave the cloud and
rain behind.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page4" id = "page4">4</a></span>
<h5>July 10.&mdash;</h5>

<p>The day passed as days at sea do when the weather is all that can be
wished, and the treacherous ocean calmly sleeps. The passengers were as
sociable as any collection of English people ever are, and we spent the
time very pleasantly chatting, smoking, eating enormously, and playing
the ordinary sea games of quoits and horse-billiards.</p>

<p>The Skipper was much exercised in spirit because Esau had told him
that he believed a certain passenger to be an acquaintance of a former
voyage, named, let us say, Jones, and that he was a capital fellow. So
the Skipper went and fraternised with Jones, and presently, trusting to
the ‘information received,’ remarked, ‘I&nbsp;believe your name is
Jones?’ and was a little annoyed when Jones replied, ‘No, it’s not
Jones; it’s Blueit, and I never heard the name of Jones as a surname
before.’ Then the Skipper arose and remonstrated with his perfidious
friend, who with great good temper said, to make it all right, ‘You see
that man by the funnel? That is a Yankee going to see the midnight sun;
go and talk to him.’ Now the Skipper has been in America a good deal,
and likes to talk to the natives of those regions, so he sailed over to
the funnel and tackled the Yankee. Presently, with that admirable tact
which is his most enviable characteristic, he observed,
‘I&nbsp;understand that you have come all the way from America to see
the midnight sun: it is a very extraordinary phenomenon. Imagine a
glorious wealth of colour glowing
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page5" id = "page5">5</a></span>
over an eternal sunlit sea, and endowing with a fairy glamour a scene
which Sappho might have burned to sing; where night is not, nor sleep,
but Odin’s eye looks calmly down, nor ever sinks in rest.’ As he paused
for breath the Yankee saw his opportunity, and said, ‘No, I&nbsp;was
never in America in my life. I&nbsp;am a Lincolnshire man, and am going
over to Arendahl to buy timber. I&nbsp;have seen the midnight sun some
dozen times, and I call it an infernal nuisance.’ Here the Skipper
hastily left, and came over and abused Esau until he made an enemy of
him for life.</p>

<span class = "subhead">CHRISTIANIA.</span></h3>


<h5>Sunday, July 11.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">We</span> reached Christiansand about six,
and set sail again at eight. There was what the mariners called a nice
breeze with us. Esau declared it to be a storm, and was prostrate at
lunch, owing as he said to attending church service, which was conducted
under considerable difficulties, members of the congregation
occasionally shooting out of the saloon like Zazel out of her cannon, or
assuming recumbent postures when the rubric said, ‘Here all standing
up.’ However, we came along at a great pace, and arrived at Christiania
about nine at night, after a first-rate passage.</p>

<p>The Fjord was not looking as beautiful as usual, as there had been a
great deal of rain, and the storm clouds and mist were still hovering
about the low hills, so that no glories of the northern sunset were
visible.</p>

<p>We arranged that the Skipper should go straight to the Victoria Hotel
for rooms, as we heard that the town was very full, and Esau was to
follow with the luggage. Now there was a young Englishman on board, very
talkative, extremely sociable, remarkably
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page7" id = "page7">7</a></span>
kind-hearted, and overflowing with the best advice. He had gone round
the whole ship entreating every one to go to the ‘Grand,’ as he intended
to do, because it was by far the best hotel.</p>

<p>Just as the Skipper had engaged our rooms at the ‘Victoria,’ in
rushed this guileless child of nature, panting from the speed at which
he had come from the quay, and the Skipper had the gratification of
witnessing his discomfiture and listening to his apologies for having
lied unto us, which of course he had done in order to get rooms for his
own party at the ‘Victoria.’</p>

<p>We say nothing against the ‘Grand’ because we know it not, but any
one who has once tried the ‘Victoria’ will go there again: the man who
is not at home and happy there must be a very young traveller.</p>

<p>This hotel possesses a spacious courtyard, surrounded by galleries
from which bedrooms and passages open, very much like that historical
hostelry in the Borough at which Mr. Pickwick first encountered Sam
Weller.</p>

<p>These galleries, and indeed most portions of the hotel, are made of
wood, and the building is not of recent date, for now no houses in
Christiania are allowed to be constructed of timber only.</p>

<p>In the centre of the court is a fountain which keeps up a gentle
plashing, very pleasant to listen to on a day when the thermometer is at
90 in the shade,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page8" id = "page8">8</a></span>
as it generally is about this time of year in Christiania. All round the
fountain are small tables and chairs, ready for the little groups who
will assemble at them after dinner for the cup of coffee and glass of
cognac which form an indispensable part of a Norwegian dinner. The
dinner itself is, during the summer months, always served in a large
oblong tent in the same courtyard at 2.30, and a very pleasant meal it
is, if you are not too much wedded to English habits to be able to
secure an appetite at that hour. At short intervals down the table large
blocks of ice are placed, which perform excellent service in helping to
keep the tent cool.</p>

<p>Then there is another delightful resort, the smoking-room, which is
upstairs on an extension of the gallery overlooking the courtyard. It
also is covered by a sort of tent, in the roof of which divers strange
and gruesome birds and beasts disport themselves, or seem to do so: we
have reason to believe that they are stuffed, as we notice that the
flying capercailzie never seems to ‘get any forrader;’ the fox stealing
with cautious tread upon the timid hare, unaccountably delays his final
spring, but perhaps he is right not to hurry, for the hare does not
appear to be taking any measures for her safety, but sits calmly
nibbling the deeply dyed moss which it were vain to inform her is not
good to eat. But there are other birds which we <i>know</i> are stuffed,
for we helped to stuff them, and these are the sparrows, which come
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page9" id = "page9">9</a></span>
gaily flying in at the open side of the smoking balcony; hopping on the
chairs and tables, pecking at the crumbs on your plate, and behaving
generally in that peculiarly insolent manner which can only be acquired,
even by a sparrow, after years of study, and the most complete
familiarity with the subject. These birds are a source of endless
delight to Esau, who certainly gives them more than can be good for
them; they eat twice as much as the capercailzies, though the latter are
considerably larger. And if the sparrows are not enough entertainment,
there are tanks of gold-fish and trees of unknown species in pots; but
neither of these perform very interesting feats.</p>

<p>In this room it is the custom of the ordinary traveller to have his
breakfast and supper. Breakfast is very much like a good English one,
except the coffee, which is not at all like English coffee, being
perfectly delicious; but the supper is a meal peculiar to Norway, and is
generally constructed more or less on the following principles:</p>

<p>Caviare, with a fresh lemon cut up on it.</p>

<p>Norwegian sardines, garnished with parsley and bay leaves.</p>

<p>Cray-fish boiled in salt water.</p>

<p>Prawns of appalling magnitude.</p>

<p>Bologna sausage in slices.</p>

<p>Chickens.</p>

<p>Slices of beef, tongue, and corned beef.</p>

<p>Reindeer tongue.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page10" id = "page10">10</a></span>
<p>Brod Lax (spelling not guaranteed), meaning raw salmon smoked and cut
in thin slices.</p>

<p>Baked potatoes.</p>

<p>Good butter, and rolls which no man can resist, so fresh are they,
and light, and crisp.</p>

<p>Drink: ‘salon öl,’ which is the best Norwegian beer.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

alt = "Norwegian Arrangement of Dishes at Table"></p>

<p>This supper does not come in in courses, but the whole of it is
placed on the table at once; not spread out all over the surface of the
board as at home, but arranged in small oval dishes all round the
consumer, and radiating within easy reach from his plate, making his
watch-chain the centre of a semicircle, and thus entirely dispensing
with that creaking-booted fidget, the waiter. Such an arrangement
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page11" id = "page11">11</a></span>
cannot fail to coax the most delicate appetite. There is no coarse
<i>pièce de résistance</i>; no vast joint to disgust you; but like the
bee, you flit from dish to dish, toying, now with a prawn, now with a
merry-thought, till you suddenly discover that you are unconsciously
replete, and you rise from the table feeling that it was a good supper,
and that existence is not such a struggle after all.</p>

<p>Altogether the ‘Victoria’ is a most charming inn, either to the
wave-worn mariner wearied by the cruel buffetings of the North Sea, or
to the weather-beaten sportsman returning straight from the bleak
snow-fields of the interior of Norway. We never stayed there for more
than two days, but for that time it is an uninterrupted dream of
delight.</p>

<h5>July 12.&mdash;</h5>

<p>We had a very hard day, buying all sorts of things to make our stores
complete: jam, butter, whisky, soap, and matches, Tauchnitz books, and
several other necessaries. The butter is most important, as the best
variety that can be got up country is extremely nasty; the worst is
unutterably vile, though it is quite possible to acquire almost a liking
for the peculiarities of the better kind after starvation has stared you
in the face. We were much put out at not being able to get a small keg
of whisky, as we fear that the bottles will fare badly in the rough
travelling we shall have.</p>

<p>Accounts of Christiania may be found in many excellent guide-books,
with which this simple story
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page12" id = "page12">12</a></span>
cannot hope to compete, so we will not attempt to describe the town,
since, though our knowledge of all the grocers’ shops is voluminous and
exhaustive, we are totally ignorant of the interior arrangements of
either the churches or police stations.</p>

<p>The Skipper was very anxious to get some violet ink, because he is
firmly convinced that it is the only sort fit for a gentleman to use.
‘A&nbsp;man,’ he said, ‘is known by his ink;’ so we went into many shops
and asked for that concoction, always in the English tongue. Then we
arrived at a shop where they did not speak our language; and here
suddenly, to the intense surprise of Esau, the Skipper broke forth into
a long harangue in Norse, concluding with an extremely neat peroration.
The shopkeeper listened with respectful admiration, and then said, ‘No,
this is a stationer’s shop, we do not keep it.’ Then Esau gave way to
irreverent laughter, and the shopkeeper concluded that we were
attempting a practical joke, and we had to fly. The Skipper was not
angry, but very much hurt. It afterwards transpired that he had got up
the whole of that magnificent burst of eloquence out of ‘Bennett’s
Phrase Book,’ and then it had failed for want of two or three right
words; truly very hard.</p>

<p>We took our canoes to the railway station, and despatched them to
Lillehammer this afternoon; they had been a source of great interest to
all beholders since our arrival, especially to the Norwegians, who
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page13" id = "page13">13</a></span>
have all a sort of natural affinity with any kind of boat, and seem very
much pleased with the combined lightness and strength of their build. As
far as we can learn they are the first of the kind that have yet been
brought to this country.</p>

<p>At the station they were surrounded by a crowd of inquiring Norsemen,
all of them wondering much what the name of ‘Nettie’ on the bows of the
Skipper’s craft could mean, and spelling it over very slowly and
carefully aloud. When we came away, one of them, evidently a linguist,
had just translated it into his own language, and was proceeding to
conjugate it as an irregular verb.</p>

<h5>July 13.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">We</span> were engaged till late at night
putting the finishing touches to our packing. The last thing we did was
to put our most gorgeous apparel, and any articles not likely to be
needed during our camp life, into two portmanteaus, with strict orders
to the Boots to keep the same until our return. This morning, after an
early breakfast, on descending to the courtyard we found these
portmanteaus roped down on the roof of the omnibus which was to take all
the luggage to the station <i>en route</i> for Lillehammer. This we
rectified, and then set off to walk to the station ourselves.</p>

<p>Now Esau is possessed by an insensate craving for anchovy paste,
which he considers a necessity for camping; he said, ‘It imparts a
certain tone to the stomach, and aids digestion;’ and added that ‘no
well-appointed dinner-table should ever be without it,’ which sounds a
little like an advertisement, but which he asserted was a quotation from
the rules laid down for his diet by Dr. Andrew Clark. In Christiania
these rules are not strictly adhered to either by
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page15" id = "page15">15</a></span>
Esau or the inhabitants of the place, for anchovy paste is not to be
obtained there: this we know, because we went into every shop in the
town, and asked for it without success. And in this supreme moment, when
we were walking to the station with only a few minutes before the train
should start, he insisted on diving into a wretched pokey little shop,
which had escaped our notice yesterday, and demanding ‘anchovy paste’ in
a loud English voice. The Skipper devoutly thanked Providence it could
not be bought, as he declared the smell of it alone was enough to put a
man off his breakfast, and that he had such a morbid longing for hair
grease, that he could not have prevented himself from putting it on his
head.</p>

<p>We got our baggage safely booked, and ourselves also, after a scene
of riot that was nothing like a football match, but something like
Donnybrook fair, and at last found ourselves in a compartment with five
other passengers, all of whom had a most inconsiderate amount of luggage
with them in the carriage, while we contented ourselves with four guns,
seven fishing-rods, two axes, one spade, four hundred and fifty
cartridges, two fishing-bags, and a pair of glasses. We calculated that
we saved at least one and fourpence by taking these things with us; and
although our fellow-passengers were rather profane at first they soon
settled down, and we had time to digest the fact that we were one and
fourpence to the good. It
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page16" id = "page16">16</a></span>
was very warm in there; outside the thermometer was 92° in the shade;
but we survived it, and after that no mere heat has any terrors
for&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>Two of our fellow-passengers were an Englishman and his wife, who had
a maid travelling with them through to Throndhjem; and when getting the
tickets the booking clerk informed them that there were no second-class
through tickets issued, ‘but,’ he added, ‘this will do as well,’ and
handed them one first and one third through ticket, which we thought an
extremely ingenious way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>A railway journey is not interesting anywhere, and less so in Norway
than other countries, as there is not even the sensation of speed to
divert your mind, and keep you excited in momentary expectation of a
smash. Uphill the pace is slow because it cannot be fast; downhill it is
slow for fear of the train running away.</p>

<p>There are only two trains a day, one very early, one rather late, but
timed to arrive at its destination before dark, for there is no
travelling by night. Directly darkness comes on the train is stopped,
and the passengers turned out into an hotel, where they remain to rest
till dawn. From Christiania to Eidsvold is about a three-hour journey,
and during that time the guard came to look at our tickets 425 times. He
wanted to incite us to commit a breach of the peace, or to catch us
offending against some of his by-laws, and was always appearing at a new
place; first at
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page17" id = "page17">17</a></span>
one door, then the other, anon peeping at us through the hole for the
lamp, and again blinking from the next carriage, through the ice-water
vessel. But we were aware of his intention, and did nothing to annoy
him, and always showed the same tickets till they were worn out, and
then we produced strawberry jam labels, which seemed to be quite
satisfactory.</p>

<p>We reached Eidsvold at twelve, and went aboard the steamer
‘Skiblädner,’ where we found the canoes already nicely placed, lashed on
the paddle-boxes.</p>

<p>We had a delightful voyage up the Mjösen, on the most beautiful of
Norwegian summer days, in the best of Norwegian steamers. The Mjösen is
the largest Norwegian lake, about fifty-five miles long, and the
guide-books say it is 1,440 feet deep, but we had not time to measure
it, as we were busy admiring the scenery on the saloon table most of the
way. This steaming up the Mjösen is a very pleasant way of spending a
fine day: the shores are nowhere strikingly beautiful, but always pretty
and charming; the steamer goes fast, so that there is a sensation of
getting on and not losing time. There are intervals of mild excitement
whenever we come to a village, and take up or disembark passengers;
generally speaking they come out in boats, but occasionally we come to a
larger and more important place where there is a pier, or even a
railway, and at these the excitement is greater and the crowd quite
worthy of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page18" id = "page18">18</a></span>
the name. The folks all take off their hats directly we get within
sight, and continue to do so till they fade away or sink below the
horizon; and we in the steamer all do the same. But the great attraction
is undoubtedly dinner, which is uncommonly well served in the saloon,
every luxury that can be obtained being placed before us, concluding
with wild strawberries and cream of the frothiest and most captivating
appearance.</p>

<p>Both on this boat and her sister the ‘Kong Oscar’ they take great
pride in doing things well, very much as the old mail-coaches which
occupied a parallel position in England used to do. The ‘Kong Oscar’ is
rather the faster boat, but we consider the captain of the ‘Skiblädner’
to be lengths ahead of his rival, being a first-rate old fellow; on the
other hand, the ‘Skiblädner’ handmaidens are not comely, whereas they of
the ‘Kong Oscar’ are renowned for their beauty, not only in Norway, but
in certain stately homes of England that we wot of. Esau lost his heart
to one of them two years ago, and still raves about her, though the only
way in which he endeavoured to win her affection was by sitting on a
paddle-box with his slouch hat tilted over his eyes, gazing at her with
mute admiration from a respectful distance, while she, alas! was totally
unconscious of his passion. He never told his love, because he could not
speak Norse.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page19" id = "page19">19</a></span>
<p>We arrived at Lillehammer about eight o’clock, and went to the
Victoria Hotel, from the flat roof of which, after an excellent dinner,
we enjoyed a pipe and one of the prettiest views, in a quiet homely
style of prettiness, that any one could wish to see: just at our feet
the wooden village, with its many-coloured houses and their red roofs;
then some green slopes, and 100 feet below the vast extent of the Mjösen
lying calm and still and looking very green and deep, with the
landing-stage and deserted steamers apparently quite close below us. On
the opposite side of the lake highish hills covered with fir trees, and
to the right the river Laagen with its green waters hurrying down from
the mountains in a broad and rapid stream as far as the eye could reach.
Just across the road in front of the hotel there is a nice little stream
which turns a saw, and rejoices in a cool splashing waterfall, the
soothing sound of which refreshes us by day and night. The same torrent
can be seen higher up the mountain in a place where it makes some rather
fine falls, which only look like a long white rag fluttering amongst the
trees at this distance. This was the view we had at midnight, when it
was, apparently, no darker than immediately after sunset, and a good
deal lighter than it generally is in London at midday; the while the sky
was covered with the rich glow of colouring which can only be seen in
the Northern summer.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page20" id = "page20">20</a></span>
<p>There were two Englishmen with us on the roof, with whom, aided by
coffee, we roamed over the greater part of the civilised and uncivilised
world&mdash;Australia, Canada, Japan, Turkey, and Ceylon, and we all
agreed that none of them can ‘go one better’ than a summer night in
Norway.</p>

<h5>July 14.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">We</span> arose pretty early, wishing to
get over thirty-eight miles of ground before evening, which with the
canoes would be a long day’s work; as we had the natives to contend
with, who by reason of their dreadfully lazy habits are most difficult
to ‘bring to the scratch.’</p>

<p>We have decided, after long experience, that nothing that you can do
has any effect in hurrying them; but that it is quite possible to make
them slower by losing your temper, or taking any vigorous measures of
acceleration. They seem to get more deliberate and aggravatingly slow as
they grow older.</p>

<p>Norwegian boys are distractingly restless and full of energy, and
look as if they have had nothing to eat, which is generally the actual
fact, judging by an English standard of what constitutes food. At the
age of fifteen they become better fed, and their energy departs
altogether, and after entirely disappearing it keeps getting less every
year. A&nbsp;full-grown man does not seem to need much food, certainly
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page22" id = "page22">22</a></span>
not as much as an Englishman, and prefers that of the worst kind,
conveyed to the mouth at the end of a knife-blade. We have never noticed
any description of food which he does not make sour, rather than eat it
when sweet. Bread, milk, cream, and cheese, jam and cabbages, for
instance, are articles which he prefers fermented or sour. He reminds
one of the cockney who complained that the country eggs had no flavour,
or of the Scotchman who, replying to the apologies of a friend in whose
house he happened to get a bad egg, said, ‘Ma dear freend, ah
<i>prefair</i> ’em rotten.’</p>

<p>But his laziness and love of nasty food are almost the only bad
qualities that we have discovered in him. He is ridiculously honest,<a
class = "star" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">*</a> and his
kindness and hospitality are beyond praise. This morning, however, the
laziness was the quality chiefly conspicuous, and though we ordered our
conveyances last night and got up early (for us), we did not succeed in
starting till twelve o’clock.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a class = "star" name = "note1" id = "note1" href = "#tag1">*</a>
Save, perhaps, on three points&mdash;fishing tackle, strong drinks, and
straps or pieces of cord, which may be committed to memory as
‘a&nbsp;fly, a&nbsp;flask, and a fastener.’</p>

<p>We first despatched the canoes and baggage packed on a kind of low
waggon, and then got into a double cariole (which is something like a
gig) ourselves, and drove gaily off along the Throndhjem road. We did
not, however, follow it far, but turning to the left down a steep hill,
we crossed the Laagen by a long and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page23" id = "page23">23</a></span>
rather handsome bridge, and then up a winding road on the further side,
all looking very pretty on such a glorious day. The road became more
picturesque the further we got from Lillehammer, every turn bringing us
to some fresh combination of mountain, pine-trees, rock, and
waterfall&mdash;especially rock. There are so many tracts of country in
Norway entirely composed of rock, that, as Esau remarked, ‘probably no
one will ever find a use for it all.’</p>

<p>We lunched at a nice little station called ‘Neisteen;’ a delicious
meal <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged: may be error for ‘of’">off</ins> trout, strawberries and cream, and fladbrod, for which
they charged us a shilling each.</p>

<p>‘Fladbrod’ is the staple food of the country folk in Norway; they
make it of barley-meal, rye-meal, or pea-meal, but the best and
commonest is that composed of barley-meal. It is simply meal and water
baked on a large, flat, circular iron, and is about the thickness of
cardboard, of a brownish colour, and very crisp. The taste for it is
easily acquired in the absence of other food, and with butter it becomes
quite delicious&mdash;to a <i>very</i> hungry man.</p>

<p>At Neisteen there was a little shop where the Skipper at last
obtained his violet ink, but Esau was foiled in his dastardly attempt at
retaliation with anchovy paste.</p>

<p>After this our road lay along a lovely river for fishing, and we were
much tempted to stop and try a cast in it, especially as we saw natives
luring fish
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page24" id = "page24">24</a></span>
from their rocky haunts by the time-honoured Norwegian method. They
first settle how far they want to cast&mdash;say thirty feet. Then cut
down a thirty-foot pine tree; take the bark off it; tie a string to the
thin end and a hook to the string; stick a worm on the hook, and go
forth to the strife. When the fish bites, they strike with great
rapidity and violence, and <i>something</i> is bound to go; generally it
is the fish, which leaves its native element at a speed which must
astonish it; describes half of a sixty-foot circle at the same rate, and
lands either in a tree or on a rock with sufficient force to break
itself.</p>

<p>But we had no time to spare, especially as for this stage we had a
bad, shying, jibbing horse, and a perfect fool of a driver.</p>

<p>Near the last station we passed three English people on the road, who
our driver informed us lived near there. He told us their name was
Wunkle, but the man at the next station said it was Punkum, and we could
not decide which of these two common English names it was most likely
to&nbsp;be.</p>

<p>Kvisberg, the last station on this road, was reached at 9 <span class
= "smallroman">P.M.</span>, but before this the road, which had
gradually got worse all the way from Lillehammer, had faded away and
disappeared: and as the road got worse, so did the hired conveyances; so
that we were gradually reduced from the gorgeous double cariole with red
cushions with which we started, and a horse that could hardly be held
in, to a springless, jolting
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page25" id = "page25">25</a></span>
stolkjær (country cart), and a pony that required much persuasion to
induce him to boil up a trot.</p>

<p>Kvisberg is situated, with peculiar disregard for appropriateness of
position, on the side of an almost unclimbable hill, about a quarter of
a mile from the place where the road departs into the Hereafter. No
English horse would take a cart up such a hill, but Norwegian ponies are
like the Duke’s army, and ‘will go anywhere and do anything,’ only you
must give them plenty of time. We mounted to the station,
a&nbsp;wretched little place, and being hungry ordered coffee and eggs,
for which repast we paid twopence-halfpenny each, and then at ten
o’clock got a man to carry our few small things the last six miles to
Dalbakken, where we intended to sleep the night. The walk was
delightful, through a precipitous thickly wooded gorge, at the bottom of
which the river which we had followed all day went leaping and foaming
along, though it was now reduced to a mere mountain torrent.</p>

<p>About a mile from our journey’s end we were overtaken by a Norwegian
student on a walking tour, who spoke a little English and walked with us
the rest of the way, as he too was bound for Dalbakken.</p>

alt = "Midnight Study of Stockings at Dalbakken"></p>

<p>We reached it at midnight, and were not much gratified to find that
it was a very small poor building, and that our luggage had not arrived.
We had been hoping against hope that it might have done so, as we had
not seen it anywhere on the road. The next
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page26" id = "page26">26</a></span>
pleasant discovery was that four other travellers had arrived before us
and taken all the rooms. This fact was first conveyed to our minds by
seeing four pairs of socks hanging out of the upstair windows to dry; at
which sight we began to suspect that things were going to turn out
unpleasant for us; but at last we got a room with one very small bed
between us. We tossed for this bed, and the Skipper won; so Esau passed
the night on the floor, on a sheepskin, and was very
comfortable&mdash;at least he said so next morning. The natives here
were much impressed by all
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page27" id = "page27">27</a></span>
our habits and belongings, but especially by our sleeping with the
window open; wherefore the old woman of the Sæter<a class = "star" name
= "tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">*</a> below kept bouncing into the
room at intervals during the night to see us perform that heroic feat;
and though it was flattering to be made so much of, still fame has its
drawbacks.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a class = "star" name = "note2" id = "note2" href = "#tag2">*</a>
A Sæter is a mountain farm, to which all the cattle are driven during
the summer, so that the lowland pastures can be mown for hay.</p>

<p>The general appearance of the place caused us to expect nightly
visitations from other foes, not human, but to our surprise there were
none.</p>

<p>Dalbakken is only three quarters of a mile from a lake called
Espedals Vand, where we propose to commence our cruise. It is
beautifully situated on a small flat bit of ground halfway up the north
side of the gorge: the hills on the south side not far away are so steep
that they could not be climbed by all the branded alpenstocks that
Switzerland ever produced. Looking to the east the gorge is very wild
and grand, covered with pine trees and steep crags, and no dwelling in
sight; while to the west, in which direction Espedals Vand lies, it is
more level and open, and slopes gradually downwards again, Dalbakken
itself being the highest point in the track.</p>

<a name = "page29" id = "page29">29</a></span>
of a mile further to go. This was very sad, and we thought showed an
unchristian spirit; but we sternly urged him forward, and all ended
happily on our arrival at Espedals, when we paid him his money and a
shilling extra.</p>

<p>It only took us a quarter of an hour to get to the lake, and after
unpacking there and dismissing the men we put the canoes into the water,
and then put water into the canoes until they sank; while we sat on the
shore watching the trout rising all over the rippled surface of the
lake, occasionally eyeing our sunken canoes in an impatient, longing
sort of way, but never attempting to start on our great voyage.</p>

<p>These tactics to an inexperienced ‘voyageur’ might look like the acts
of an ordinary lunatic; but
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page30" id = "page30">30</a></span>
it should be explained that the long exposure to the sun which the
canoes had undergone had caused them to leak badly, and they required
soaking to swell up the joints, before they could be intrusted with our
valuable property and persons. Besides this we were hungry, and thought
it a good opportunity for lunch, and had to make some previously
arranged alterations in the baggage with a view to lightening it. As
long as the land journey lasted, strength was the chief object to aim
at, but now lightness was of more importance. About one o’clock, when we
had got all our things aboard and were just starting, a&nbsp;strong
head-wind arose. This was always our luck. We decided to make only a
short voyage. The waves were fairly big, but the canoes weathered
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page31" id = "page31">31</a></span>
them bravely, though they were very low in the water, and we had to keep
the pumps going (<i>i.e.</i> mop them out with our sponges) during the
whole voyage.</p>

alt = "Our Camp on Espedals"></p>

<p>We landed not more than a mile and a half from the end of the lake,
and found a very nice camping-ground about ten yards from the shore on
the south bank, with what the poets call ‘a&nbsp;babbling brook’ close
to it; pitched the tent, and had a simple dinner of bacon, eggs, and
jam, the last dinner during our trip at which trout did not find a
place. Then we sallied forth in the canoes to fish. Esau was the last to
leave the shore, and as he paddled off he noticed the Skipper’s rod in
the familiar Norwegian shape of a bow, and found him struggling with two
on at the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page32" id = "page32">32</a></span>
same time, both of which he landed, and found to be over 1 lb. each.
‘First blood claimed and allowed,’ to quote the terse language of the
prize ring. Not a bad beginning, but we only got a few more about the
same weight. They came very short, but were remarkably game fish when
hooked, and in first-rate condition. We turned in about eleven, when it
began to rain a little, and slept with our heads under the blankets, the
mosquitoes being in countless multitudes.</p>

<h5>July 16.&mdash;</h5>

<p>It was a lovely morning, and the lake looked its best, but it is not
strikingly beautiful compared with many that we have seen. It has high
rugged hills on both sides, and pine woods down to the water’s edge, and
some small islands dotted about the upper end of it; but the lake is
rather shallow, the pine trees rather stunted, and there are a good many
wooden huts and sæters on the hill-sides, which, although they appear to
be mostly uninhabited, detract from the wildness of the scenery.</p>

<p>The natives have one or two boats on the lake, and do some fishing on
their own account. To-day we saw a man engaged in the atrocious
employment of fishing with an ‘otter.’</p>

<p>Any natives who see our camp when rowing past come to shore to
inspect us and our belongings. They all adopt the same course of
procedure. They land, and stare, and say nothing; then they pull up
their boat and make it safe, and advancing close
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page33" id = "page33">33</a></span>
to the tent stare, and say nothing either to each other or us. Then Esau
says confidentially, as if it was a new and brilliant idea (he has done
exactly the same thing some scores of times), ‘We’d better be civil to
these fellows; perhaps they could bring us some eggs, and they look
pretty friendly.’ The natives are all the time staring and saying
nothing. Then Esau remarks in Norwegian, ‘It is fine weather to-day;
have you any eggs?’ To this the chief native replies at great length in
his own barbarous jargon, and Esau not having understood a single
syllable answers, ‘Ja! ja! (yes), but have you any eggs?’ Then aside to
the Skipper, ‘Wonder what the deuce the fool was talking about?’ Soon
the natives perceive that their words are wasted, and relapse into the
silent staring condition again, and after a time and a half, or two
times, they depart as they came. Sometimes they return again with eggs
in a basket, when we pay them well and give them some fish; at other
times they look upon us as dangerous lunatics, and avoid us like the
plague.</p>

<p>Esau learnt this habit of asking for eggs when we were on a fishing
expedition near the south coast of Norway. On one occasion there we
arrived at a small village, with an enormous quantity of trout that we
had caught in the adjoining fjord; and found a small crowd of about
fourteen or fifteen seafaring men, idly lounging round an open space
between the cottages. He first went round and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page34" id = "page34">34</a></span>
presented each of those men with two trout solemnly, without a word, as
though it were a religious ceremony. Then he began at the first man
again and said, ‘Have you eggs?’ and receiving a reply in the negative,
he went on to the next, and to each one of the group asking the same
weird question.</p>

<p>The men, who had been chatting busily amongst themselves up to the
moment of our arrival, became silent; they did not laugh, but only
looked at one another; and one of them shyly felt in his pocket to see
if there were any eggs there whose existence he might have chanced to
forget.</p>

<p>Presently, as we could get no eggs, we moved off sorrowfully but not
discouraged; and the men remained looking after us silent and uncertain.
Thus the interview ended, and we regained our boat.</p>

<p>The beach here was capital for bathing, and we enjoyed a delightful
tub this morning, the more pleasant indeed because at Dalbakken we slept
in our clothes, and only had a soap-dish to wash in next morning.
Immediately after bathing we lit a fire, and the cook commenced
operations; the office of cook being held alternately by each of us for
one day. The man from Dalbakken brought us some milk, so we indulged in
coffee. When we have only ‘tin milk’ we drink tea; for though tin milk
will do fairly with tea, we think it wretched with coffee. After
breakfast we each took our canoe, and went fishing wherever the spirit
moved us, taking lunch
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page35" id = "page35">35</a></span>
with us. On a day of this sort, if the fish are rising we have a great
time, and if they won’t rise, we lie on the bank in the sun and smoke,
or sketch, or kill mosquitoes, and have a great time in that case also,
so that the hours pass in a blissful round of enjoyment, and all is
peace. Having each one his own ship we are quite independent, only
taking care to return to camp about six o’clock to get dinner ready.
After that there is nearly always a rise, and we fish till about eleven,
when we generally turn in, though it is by no means dark by that time;
and on a few occasions when the fish were rising very well, we have
fished on all through the night and into the next day, losing count of
the almanack, and conducting life on the principles of going to bed when
tired, and eating when hungry, so that, like the Snark, we might be
said&nbsp;to&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Frequently breakfast at five o’clock tea,</p>
<p class = "indent">And dine on the following day.</p>
</div>

<p>There was very little wind to-day, and these fish being very shy, and
apt to come short, it was almost impossible to get them without a ripple
until evening, when large white moths began to show on the water, and
the trout became bolder; consequently we did not make great bags, though
the fish caught were very good ones.</p>

<p>At night there was one of the most lovely sunsets ever seen. The sun
went down right at the other end of the lake, so that we had an
uninterrupted view,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page36" id = "page36">36</a></span>
with all the glorious colours of the sky reflected in the water; and we
agreed that the effects about half-past ten this evening formed as good
a symphony in purple and orange as a man could expect to find out of the
Grosvenor Gallery.</p>

<h5>July 17.&mdash;</h5>

<p>The morning began with a dead calm, but this soon gave place to such
a wind down the lake that we were induced to strike the camp, pack the
canoes, and proceed on our voyage into the unknown.</p>

alt = "Black-throated Diver"></p>

<p>We started soon after eleven, lunched near Megrunden,<a class =
"star" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">*</a> and saw there two
black-throated divers on the lake, which Esau pursued for some time, but
of course never got near them. Some of the dives they made to avoid his
advancing canoe seemed to be about half a mile in length. Just below
Böle we caught several fish, but kept paddling on with our
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page37" id = "page37">37</a></span>
favourable wind, casting every now and then in likely places, and soon
came to a rapid with a rough bridge thrown across its upper end. The
rapid was very shallow, so that we did not dare to attempt to run it
with loaded boats, and had to make a portage. Even then we got a few
bumps in running it, but arrived at the bottom all right. Now the scene
changed; we were in a smaller and narrower part of the valley; buildings
had entirely disappeared; there was nothing to be seen but gloomy pine
forests and black-looking mountains: the weather also was quickly
changing, and evidently intending to be wet and stormy; so we pushed on
rapidly, one coasting on each side of the lake till we reached its
further extremity, where Esau was nearly swamped crossing the waves, as
the wind began to blow harder every minute. Soon the rain was upon us,
while we looked for a camping-ground but found none, as the shores were
everywhere very swampy for a quarter of a mile inland. At length we came
to a second rapid, where the natives have thrown a clumsy weir across
for some unknown purpose, and here we found a fairly dry spot, made our
portage in heavy rain and wind, with a great deal of groaning, misery,
and brandy and water; pitched the tent, and after struggling for about
half an hour, got a dyspeptic fire to fizzle, and so cooked some fish
and eggs, and then had tea in the tent. After this we were a little more
comfortable, as it was very nice and dry inside; but it was
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page38" id = "page38">38</a></span>
midnight before we had finished all our portage, got the canoes down
into the next lake, and made everything snug for the night, so that we
were quite exhausted, as our day had commenced at seven <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span> The mosquitoes were more numerous here than at
any place we have yet seen.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a class = "star" name = "note3" id = "note3" href = "#tag3">*</a>
The various places mentioned on the voyage are not villages, as one
might imagine from the dot that marks them on the Ordnance map, but
generally only a single one-roomed log hut, and for the most part not
inhabited or habitable.</p>

<h5>Sunday, July 18.&mdash;</h5>

<p>It rained all night, but as Tweedledum said of his umbrella, ‘not
under here,’ and a ditch we made last night kept our floor quite dry.
Lighting a fire for breakfast was a toilsome business, but at last we
found some wood dry enough to burn. It continued raining in a nice
keep-at-it-all-day-if-you-like kind of manner, so we resided in the
tent, and read, and indulged in whisky and water for lunch to counteract
any ill effects of the reading&mdash;for some of it was poetry.</p>

<p>Our tent was about three-quarters of a mile from the end of Bred Sjö,
and after lunch we both went in one canoe to reconnoitre the next rapid,
which is a long one down to Olstappen Vand. We found that it is quite
impracticable for canoes; the river simply running violently down a
steep place till it perishes in the lake; about a mile of rapid with
hardly enough decently behaved water in the whole of it to hold a dozen
trout. But there <i>were</i> a dozen, for we caught them, one wherever
there was a little turnhole. How we were to get down that river was
concealed in the unfathomable depths of the mysterious Future.</p>

<h5>July 19.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">It</span> rained all night again and all
day. This was dreadful, and not at all like Norway.</p>

<p>We have always made a rule that we may fish on Sunday, but not shoot.
Some people draw an even finer distinction, and say it is allowable to
shoot with a rifle, but not with a gun: this we have always thought too
subtle. Now yesterday was Sunday, and Esau having observed two divers on
the lake while the Skipper was out fishing, went and secreted himself
with a gun where he expected them to come over, hoping that they would
be alarmed by the other canoe on its return. This soon happened, and
they flew within forty yards of him. Both barrels were discharged, and
Esau returned to camp, muttering something about ‘birds of that kind
having immortal bodies if they hadn’t immortal souls.’ The result of
Sabbath-breaking was no doubt this miserable weather.</p>

<p>The camp to-day presented a most cheerless prospect. The canoes were
drawn up on land and turned bottom upwards; the kitchen stowed away
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page40" id = "page40">40</a></span>
under a soaked sack; a&nbsp;very third-rate camp fire smouldering before
the tent, surrounded by old egg-shells, backbones of fish, bacon-rind,
and some apology for firewood; our two rods standing up against the
gloomy sky with the wind whistling through their lines, and all the
scenery blotted out with rain and mist, and scudding, never-ending
clouds that drifted down the valley, and gave very occasional glimpses
of extremely wet mountains. The cook, clad in a macintosh with a spade
in his hand, watching a pot which was trying to boil on the spluttering
fire, his trousers tucked into his socks, and his boots shining with
wet, would have given any one a pretty good idea of the meaning of the
expression ‘played out.’</p>

<p>The mosquitoes were bad here, and we spent much of our leisure time
making war against them.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page41" id = "page41">41</a></span>
Esau’s favourite way of ‘clearing the road’ was to bring in a smoking
log of pitch pine, close up the ventilation, and fill the tent with
smoke. It forced us to quit, but not the mosquitoes, as they appeared to
fall into a deep and tranquil sleep, from which they awoke refreshed and
ready to renew the attack just a few minutes before the tent again
became habitable for human beings. Prowling round the tent and squashing
them with our fingers was perhaps the best plan, but we were obliged to
sleep with a rug over our heads and covered up at every point, to avoid
their intrusion at night.</p>

<h5>July 20.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Still rain, and nothing but rain; it stopped for an hour or two last
night, and the lake looked uncommonly pretty among its dark
surroundings, but the downpour soon began again.</p>

<p>In our desperation yesterday afternoon we arranged with a native,
whom the Skipper discovered, to bring a horse and sleigh to-day to meet
us at the next rapid, and help us down with our baggage to Olstappen.
Therefore we got up early and were down at the rapid about ten o’clock,
where we found our man waiting. The rain at this period was the worst
variety we have yet seen, and it has tried all kinds during the last
four days. We packed everything on the sleigh, covered it with our
ground sheets, and then put the wheels on our canoes, and followed down
the track.</p>

<p>There is a saw-mill halfway down the river which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page42" id = "page42">42</a></span>
is simply perfect. It is perched on piles over the middle of the stream,
where it dashes through a rift in a huge black cliff, and the water goes
tearing past down a long shoot made of logs, and plunges down at the end
churned into a mass of white foam, with noise and spray that quite
bewilder one.</p>

<p>We got down to Olstappen at last, not without a good deal of hard
work, and paid our man 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> On our way we met a
Norwegian tourist, who was on a walking tour with his sister, and had
left her rained up, so to speak, in a Sæter, and was strolling about in
the forest to wile away the time: he spoke a very little English, and we
had a long talk with him; as he had a fellow-feeling for us, and was
quite ready to curse the rain with us or any one else.</p>

<p>The Norwegians, men and women, seem to go a good deal on walking
tours, and probably know infinitely more of their fatherland than does
the average Briton of this island, the superiority of which he seldom
fails to impress on the long-suffering foreigner.</p>

<p>At midday we launched our canoes on Olstappen, which is a fine wide
lake, and not so rainy as Bredsjö, being several hundred feet lower. We
paddled across to the mouth of the Vinstra River, a&nbsp;rather perilous
undertaking, for where the wind met the river there was a nasty sea on,
and we shipped some water, but got safe to land. We could not find a
decent camp till we had walked a quarter of a mile
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page43" id = "page43">43</a></span>
from the lake up the river. There we found a nice sheltered place,
pretty, and close to the river, made our portage, and pitched the tent,
and with tea our drooping spirits began to revive (who is proof against
a hot meal of trout and bacon, buttered eggs, and tea?), even though our
clothes and equipments were all wet through, and we had a damp change of
raiment, sleeping rugs, and boots. But now the wind had changed, and we
looked forward to the morrow as the wearied traveller always <i>does</i>
look forward to the morrow.</p>

<p>There were many sandpipers at the mouth of this river; we caught one
young one, and had serious thoughts of taking its innocent life for our
tea, but better feelings prevailed, and we released it as an offering
for fine weather, and caught four trout instead.</p>

<h5>July 21.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Hurrah! the rain stopped during the night, and this morning actually
the sun shone out now and then. We heaped up a huge fire and dried all
our belongings, and then had nearly a whole day before us free for
fishing.</p>

<p>A voyaging day is a big business. We calculate that it takes us two
and a half hours to pack up from an old camp, breakfast, and get aboard
ship; but to pitch the camp in a new place takes much longer. First you
have to find a suitable place, often a matter of great difficulty in a
country like this, where level spaces a yard square are very rare; dig a
trench; pitch the tent, and arrange everything in it; collect
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page44" id = "page44">44</a></span>
firewood, and make a place for the fire; see that the boats and
everything about the tent are safe from harm should the stormy winds
begin to blow; and then cook dinner. All this cannot be done under three
hours of hard work; so that if in addition you propose getting over a
considerable amount of ground, it is sure to be a long and toilsome day.
But the following day you wake up with a glorious feeling of duty
performed and pleasure to look forward&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>The Skipper, with a hankering after cleanliness, washed a lot of
clothes, and himself, having left the rain to perform the latter
operation for the last two or three days; but Esau, not being troubled
with any such absurd remnants of civilisation, went up the river
reconnoitring in his natural condition. He came back to dinner in a
perfectly rapturous state, having caught a remarkably nice bag of fish,
got a beautiful view of the Jotunfjeld Mountains, and found a waterfall,
which he said was the best in Norway, and therefore in the world. The
Skipper had tried the lake in the afternoon without success, so after
dinner we both went out and soon discovered the reason. Seven boats full
of natives were out with a huge flue net, which they shot in a circle,
and then beat the water enclosed till all the wretched fish were in the
net. We saw them get thirty in one haul, and besides this there was a
boat ‘ottering;’ and although we captured a few fish, it was obvious
that with all this netting it would be impossible for the lake to be
good.</p>

<h5>July 22.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">This</span> was a really fine day, such as
we consider proper to Norway; no uncertain half-and-halfness, but a day
when an untiring sun shone down from an immaculate sky; and everything
looked lovely. Our tent was on a nice bit of turf close to the Vinstra
River, which is about as broad as the Thames at Eton, but with probably
twice the volume of water, and certainly three times its rapidity; it
rushed past our door at such a pace that no boat could stem it; and as
far as we could see up the reach it came down in an equally swift
torrent, so that all day and all night there was a swilling, rushing
sound very pleasant to hear, and creating a sensation of coolness in
warm weather. Esau considered it just the <i>beau ideal</i> of a trout
stream, for any fish hooked in it gave a lot of trouble before he was
safe in the bag. It ran into the lake about a quarter of a mile from our
tent, forming a good-sized delta at its mouth. At the further side of
the delta there were some fishermen’s huts (from which emanated the
seven
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page46" id = "page46">46</a></span>
boat-loads of natives whom we saw yesterday netting), and thence a track
leads up the banks of the river to a lake called Slangen, two miles
away.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these huts came in a boat this morning to see our
camp while we were at breakfast inside the tent. They poked their heads
in, grinning and staring, and saying nothing. Then we did the honours,
showed them our most interesting possessions&mdash;American axes,
fly-books, knives, rods, &amp;c., with all of which they were greatly
impressed; then one picked up a bar of yellow soap that was lying on a
box, and they all ‘wondered much at that;’ then we talked to them for a
brief space, chiefly out of ‘Bennett’s Phrase Book,’ and considered the
interview at an end, but they <i>would</i> not go, and remained silently
staring at all our movements. So at last we ignored their presence
altogether, which we have found the most effectual way of getting rid of
a Norwegian peasant, and they gradually departed one by one till only
one was left. To this man we gave a cup of our now cold coffee, which
was not at all good, especially when compared with the delicious coffee
which is always forthcoming even in the meanest Norwegian hut. He drank
this, for they consider it a breach of etiquette to refuse proffered
food; and immediately left, as if he remembered an engagement, having
first thanked us in a rather constrained manner.</p>

<p>We were glad when our callers were gone, for we
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page47" id = "page47">47</a></span>
had found them ‘difficult,’ as the French say; but we took advantage of
their arrival to make arrangements with one of them to bring three
ponies and sleighs to the other side of the delta to-morrow morning,
when we hope to renew our journey.</p>

<p>After this we both went up the river on opposite sides; for the
Skipper had become inflamed by a wish to see the waterfall which Esau
discovered yesterday.</p>

<p>One of the great advantages of Norway consists in being able to leave
your tent and all other belongings quite to themselves, even when you
know that there are several people about, and shrewdly suspect that the
place where you have made your camp is a hay meadow belonging to one of
them. We had a dim idea that such was the case here, not because there
was any grass, but because there were very few stones, and a Norwegian
mows down everything for hay except the stones. The Skipper came back
with a very pretty bag of fish; he had been up to the fall, and thought
it quite deserved all Esau’s commendation; and his opinion is worth more
because he has seen many of the great American falls and other stock
sights of the world. It is not marked on the Ordnance map; there is no
path to it, or near it, but you come on it suddenly by following the
river up through the pine forest, and on turning a corner see the whole
body of the Vinstra shooting over a cliff in one mad leap of perhaps a
little more than a hundred
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page48" id = "page48">48</a></span>
feet. Of course the height and volume of water are insignificant
compared with many falls, but the beauty of its situation can scarcely
be excelled; and to us its greatest charm is its solitude and freedom
from paths, tourists, and all the other unpleasant attributes of show
places.</p>

<p>Esau following up the north bank of the river was not so successful
fishing, and after crossing the Slangen River (which joins the Vinstra
about a mile above our camp) he struck across the forest to see his
beloved fall again, and try to sketch it. He came back in a bad temper,
saying that he thought Ruysdael and Turner could make something of
it&mdash;the former to do the water, and the latter the spray, mist,
rainbows, and roar&mdash;and he wanted to write home and get them to
come out on purpose; and when the Skipper suggested that they had given
up painting, he said it was a great pity, for he had not time now to do
it himself.</p>

<p>There is a corduroy bridge over the Slangen River, close to its
junction with the Vinstra, and over this bridge we shall go to-morrow:
we had intended to cruise up the Slangen and fish Slangen Lake, but we
found that it would be impossible to continue our journey from the
further end of it if we did so, and therefore decided to omit that part
of the programme, though we are sorry to leave out Slangen, as it is a
beautiful lake.</p>

<p>We have probably been repaid for the miseries of

the last week by the beauty of our waterfall, the volume of which has
doubtless been much increased by the exceptional rain of the last few
days.</p>

<p>Early to bed&mdash;</p>

<h5>July 23.&mdash;</h5>

<p>And early to rise. We breakfasted soon after seven, and then packed
everything, and crossed the mouth of the Vinstra in two Norse boats,
assisted by two or three men who had come to help our horses and sleighs
on the journey. We had terrible difficulty in getting the canoes placed
in what we considered a safe position on the sleighs, but it was done at
last, and the motley caravan started about 10.30.</p>

<p>First the noble owners; then a man who had got nothing on earth to do
with the affair, then two women laughing and yelling like lunatics, then
a sleigh drawn by a large pony, and carrying two boxes, cans, guns, and
canoe; next some boys urging the large pony to herculean exertions; then
the organiser of the transport department, who was apparently a
professional fool, by the inordinate laughter which his every action
caused; then some more women, and a smaller pony and sleigh, with the
other canoe and all the rest of the luggage excepting one bag; lastly,
another man leading an extremely small pony and sleigh with absolutely
nothing on it, the man carrying the remaining bag for fear of tiring the
pony. This mob of loafers had arrived in boats from Svatsum, which is a
small village five miles distant at the north
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page50" id = "page50">50</a></span>
end of Olstappen. But they only accompanied us for a quarter of a mile,
when they all departed except the three men, who remained to manage the
ponies.</p>

<p>The pace was not very great, about a mile an hour, for these little
ponies insisted on stopping to rest every hundred yards when the path
was good, and every twenty when it was bad.</p>

<p>We followed the river till we crossed the Slangen bridge; after that
the path began to rise and get rapidly worse. We strolled along very
leisurely, sitting down from time to time to rest and admire the view.
The scenery was occasionally very beautiful, with the Jotun Mountains
gleaming white in the background; and the forest itself was an endless
delight, with its hoary moss-covered pine trees, and many-coloured
carpet of berry-bearing plants, and the delicious odours with which a
Norwegian forest in summer always abounds. In a fir tree here Esau came
upon a family of cole titmice, and another of creepers, all very busy
swinging themselves about, and creeping up and down the tree in search
of dinner. They appeared to take a certain amount of interest in his
proceedings, but showed no fear, and after watching them a long time he
put the point of his rod up to one of the titmice, which actually pecked
it rather angrily, but seeing that it made no impression took no further
notice, but returned to its occupation of collecting food. In the next
tree was a little spotted woodpecker which they call a ‘Gertrude bird.’
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page51" id = "page51">51</a></span>
The story is so prettily told in ‘Forest Life in Norway and Sweden,’
that it shall be inserted here.</p>

<p>‘This woodpecker&mdash;or an ancestor of hers&mdash;was once a woman,
and one day she was kneading bread in her trough, under the eaves of her
house, when our Lord passed by leaning on St. Peter. She did not know it
was our Lord and His apostle, for they looked like two poor men who were
travelling past her cottage door. “Give us of your dough for the love of
God,” said the Lord. “We have come far across the fjeld, and have fasted
long.”</p>

<p>‘Gertrude pinched off a small piece for them, but on rolling it in
the trough to get it into shape, it grew, and grew, and filled up the
trough completely. “No,” said she, “that is more than you want;” so she
pinched off a smaller piece and rolled it out as before, but the smaller
piece filled up the trough just as the other had done, and Gertrude put
it aside too, and pinched a smaller bit still. But the miracle was just
the same, the smaller bit filled up the trough as full as the largest
sized kneading that she had ever put into&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>‘Gertrude’s heart was hardened still more; she put that aside too,
resolving as soon as the stranger left her to divide all her dough into
little bits, and to roll it out into great loaves. “I&nbsp;cannot give
you any to-day,” said she. “Go on your journey; the Lord prosper you,
but you must not stop at my house.”</p>

<p>‘Then the Lord Christ was angry, and her eyes
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page52" id = "page52">52</a></span>
were opened, and she saw whom she had forbidden to come into the house,
and she fell down on her knees. But the Lord said, “I&nbsp;gave you
plenty, but that hardened your heart, so plenty was not a blessing to
you. I&nbsp;will try you now with the blessing of poverty; you shall
from henceforth seek your food day by day, and always between the wood
and the bark” (alluding to the custom of mixing the inner rind of the
birch with their rye-meal in times of scarcity). “But forasmuch as I see
your penitence is sincere, this shall not be for ever; as soon as your
back is entirely clothed with mourning this shall cease, for by that
time you will have learnt to use your gifts rightly.”</p>

<p>‘Gertrude flew from the presence of the Lord, for she was already a
bird, but her feathers were even now blackened from her mourning, and
from that time forward she and her descendants have all the year round
sought their food between the wood and the bark; but the feathers of
their back and wings get more mottled with black as they grow older, and
when the white is quite covered the Lord takes them for His own
again.</p>

<p>‘No Norwegian will ever hurt a Gertrude bird, for she is always under
the Lord’s protection, though He is punishing her for the time.’</p>

<p>Whether this is the true reason or not, the fact remains that the
bird is never harmed by any one, and is as tame as possible.</p>

<p>We continued climbing slowly up the hill till
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page53" id = "page53">53</a></span>
about one o’clock, when we came out above the forest on an open plateau
covered with rocks, grass, and low scrub: this was the Fjeld. At Finböle
Sæter we stopped to refresh on milk. The road&mdash;which had gradually
dwindled from a decent path to a sleigh track, then a footpath,
a&nbsp;cow-path, and a goat-path, just sufficient to swear by, or
at&mdash;now lost itself altogether. The men had been complaining that
it was a ‘<ins class = "norway" title = "dårlig vei">dole vei</ins>’
soon after the start, now they said it was ‘<ins class = "norway" title
= "slem">schlamm</ins>’&mdash;a very expressive word; and Esau agreed
with them, and said it was ‘damm schlamm,’ which does not sound like
proper Norsk; but it was such heart-rending work to see our beloved
canoes bumping and jolting along, every moment in imminent danger of
getting staved in, that to indulge in a few such Norwegian idioms was
only human; and we decided to walk on and spare ourselves the agony of
the sight: so, taking the bearings of ‘Fly Sæter’&mdash;which was our
destination for the evening&mdash;we rambled on across the fjeld&mdash;a
splendid walk, with some of the most beautiful mountains in Norway all
round&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>We got on very well with the assistance of an Ordnance map and
compass, till we came to the river Hinögle, after passing Hinögelid
Sæter. The bridge here was not in the place marked on the map, so that
after crossing it we had some trouble in finding Fly Sæter, and might
perhaps have perished miserably like the Babes in the wood, had we not
opportunely
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page54" id = "page54">54</a></span>
met a mediæval fisherman in a red night-cap, looking like one of the
demons in ‘Rip van Winkle,’ who was going thither and conducted us. We
arrived at seven o’clock, and appeased our hunger with the usual meal of
trout and coffee, and <i>such</i> cream!</p>

alt = "Sunset at Fly Sæter"></p>

<p>The sæter was a long low house, with three little rooms and only two
windows. Its legitimate tenants were a very nice man and his equally
nice wife and three children; but there were some occasional visitors
here to-night in the shape of ourselves, our three men, the mediæval
angler, and another traveller, twelve altogether to be apportioned among
four beds; and to make matters worse, the rooms were continually invaded
by sheep, pigs, and goats, of which there were a large stock.</p>

<p>The Norwegians are so uniformly kind to all their animals, that their
tameness is really troublesome;
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page55" id = "page55">55</a></span>
they insist on going where they like, and following one about begging
for food like dogs, causing the Skipper to exclaim,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Ite domum saturæ, venit Hesperus, ite capellæ;’ which he
translated&mdash;</p>

<p>Out of the house in the evening! Get out, ye goats of the sæter!</p>

<p>We slept in the cheese-room very comfortably, one on the floor, the
other on a good hay bed, and were warm for the first time for several
nights, as we have not had sufficient blankets in the tent. Where the
other ten people slept we did not inquire, but hoped they were happy.
Our men and sleighs did not arrive till 10 <span class =
"smallroman">P.M.</span>, at which time a most glorious sunset was going
on, so that we could not attend to them at once. The sky, at first blue
and yellow, gradually deepened into purple and orange, and finally the
most brilliant red and almost black clouds, the hills all the time
glowing with exquisite tints. After it was concluded we turned to the
men, and were much delighted to find that nothing was smashed so far:
the men had been very careful, and took eleven hours to perform a
journey of ten miles.</p>

<h5>July 24.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> morning was again beautifully
fine, and the coffee at the sæter was passing delicious, even for this
country, where coffee is always good. No doubt the chief reason of this
is that it is never roasted and ground till just when it is wanted, not
only at the hotels, but at the smallest sæters. The grinding of coffee
and the frying of trout are grateful sounds to the wearied traveller,
and if the walk across the fjeld has failed to give him an appetite, he
has still the chance of obtaining one from the fragrant aroma of the
roasting berry.</p>

<p>This sæter is in a most beautiful situation, perched on a little flat
bit of ground on the mountain side, and looking down on a
wide-stretching sea of grey undulating hills, with lakes lying among
them dotted about near and far, and all the lower ground covered with
the everlasting pine forest. To the south can be seen the river Hinögle,
which runs out of the Heimdal Lakes, threading its way with gleams of
white through the dark green and grey of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page57" id = "page57">57</a></span>
the forest and fjeld. To the north far below in the valley is Aakre
Vand, a&nbsp;beautiful irregularly shaped lake dotted with fir-clad
islands; while beyond, high up, there can be just distinguished Aakre
Sæter, and frowning over it the dark mass of Aakre Kampen,
a&nbsp;mountain of considerable height. Aakre Vand is a lake that we had
intended to fish after Slangen Vand, but as there seemed to be no
possibility of getting our property from one to the other we gave up the
notion. According to all accounts it is a good lake for fish, and its
shores are untainted by the habitations of man.</p>

<p>We started about 9.30, having paid 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the
board and lodging of ourselves and our numerous retinue, including the
price of a sack-full of hay for our beds, as this was the last place at
which we expected we could get any.</p>

<p>After watching for a short time our valuables jolting, plunging, and
splashing over the uneven ground, covered with rocks, junipers, and
occasional logs and brooks, the wear and tear on our heart-strings
became too severe, and we decided to walk on to Sikkildals Sæter, about
four miles, and leave the baggage to its fate under the guidance of our
three charioteers. It took us till eleven o’clock to get within half a
mile of the sæter, and there we sat down and watched the track intently
for two hours: then two hours more&mdash;and we began to lose patience;
then another hour&mdash;and we began to lose hope
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page58" id = "page58">58</a></span>
also. Something must have happened; either a canoe was smashed, or
washed away crossing a stream, or one of the sleighs was upset and
broken, or they were bogged, or the man carrying the bag had fainted, or
his pony become unmanageable and dashed through a shop window; or, most
dreadful thought, the men had got at our whisky and become hopelessly
drunk.</p>

alt = "Desperate Conflict between Esau and the Mosquito"></p>

<p>Another hour passed, and our small remaining stock of good temper
went: we were very hungry, and all our food was on the sleighs, and the
mosquitoes seemed to be even more hungry than we were. Hope deferred,
with nothing but mosquitoes to distract one’s thoughts, maketh the heart
very sick indeed: and these were most annoyingly large mosquitoes; the
finest brand that we have yet inspected, and with more strength of
character than the ordinary kind. We were so much annoyed with the world
in general, and each other, that we were obliged to separate, and Esau
retired for a short time to attempt a sketch. He
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page59" id = "page59">59</a></span>
came back very angry, because just at the critical moment a mosquito had
knocked his hat off, and he had had a desperate and perspiring conflict
with it under a tropical sun; but eventually the brute was vanquished
and its head cut off, which he said he would have stuffed, to hang up in
his ancestral halls. He certainly bore on his face the marks of the
struggle, so that there seemed to be no reason to doubt the story.</p>

ON THE TRACK NEAR SIKKILDALS LAKE.</p>

<p>Our state of despondency waxed worse and worse; we had not the
slightest confidence in our head driver; he was undoubtedly the Svatsum
village fool, for he talked all day, and the other men went into roars
of laughter at whatever he said, though the Skipper said <i>he</i>
couldn’t see anything funny in most of his remarks; but possibly the
Skipper was jealous because this man made better Norsk jokes than his
own. Besides this, the fact that neither of us understood the language,
detracted from the merits of the jests.</p>

<p>Years rolled away, and at six o’clock something came slowly into
sight. ‘Out with the glass!’ (the spy-glass). ‘Yes, by George! it is the
men and sleighs at last. Out with the other glass!’ and we finish the
‘wee drappie’ that we were saving to the last extremity. They soon
arrived at Sikkildal Sæter with us, and we found that nothing had gone
wrong, but the men had been <i>very</i> careful, and so had taken nine
hours to make a journey of four miles.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page60" id = "page60">60</a></span>
The track certainly would be a disgrace to a Metropolitan Vestry, and
they managed well to arrive with everything uninjured. We consider the
village fool to be a most painstaking and praiseworthy idiot.</p>

<p>At Sikkildal Sæter we got some food and called at a small house close
to it, where a Mr. B., a&nbsp;Norwegian barrister, was staying for the
summer. He is the owner of the Sikkildal Lakes, and we wanted permission
to camp on his land and fish in his lakes. He understood English as well
as all the upper classes in Norway do; and was very civil, giving us the
permission most willingly.</p>

<p>We have heard from a good many people that the wealthier Norwegians
do not like the English, and will not do anything to oblige them; but in
all our wanderings we have met with nothing but the greatest kindness
and hospitality from all classes. Several people have gone out of their
way to voluntarily offer fishing and shooting, and in no instance has
the slightest incivility been shown. Certainly Norway will compare with
England very much to advantage in this respect, though of course we do
not mean to say that similar conduct would be possible in England.</p>

<p>At about seven in the evening we got all our cargo shipped again and
started up the lower Sikkildals lake&mdash;having first paid our
charioteers 3<i>l.</i> for the trip from Olstappen, three men, horses
and sleighs, sixteen miles over the rockiest, brookiest, and juniperiest
country in this world; and offered them whisky and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page61" id = "page61">61</a></span>
water all round, including two men from the sæter who came to our
assistance when the smallest pony, not being accustomed to the
deceitfulness and treacherous wiles of this life, got up to its neck in
a bog close to the lake, and the man with the bag followed it. However,
they were extricated with no damage done, as our provisions were all
securely soldered up in tins. Curious to relate, our three men did not
like whisky, but just sipped for ‘manners,’ and only the two old men
from the sæter would drink it; but these two old men liked it very much,
and drank all they could get&mdash;that is to say, their own glasses
full, and the other fellows’ glasses full, and just a drop after that,
and then just a taste to top up with. Then we shook hands all round, and
feeling in charity with all men, sailed joyously away up the lake.</p>

<p>It was a real Norwegian night, with the warmth and light of the
departed sun still lingering on the mountain tops, and a midnight
twilight glowing in the valleys. We had a beautiful full moon to help us
on our way, so we went right to the upper end of the first lake, and
found a camping-ground halfway between the two lakes, which are about a
hundred yards apart. The portage took us some time, but we were full of
energy from the cool night air, so refreshing after the long hot summer
day. We dug out a nice level place for the tent, and got everything
settled and ourselves in bed about midnight.</p>

<h5>Sunday, July 25.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">We</span> arose soon after seven; not
because it is our nature to get up at that time, still less because we
think it our duty to do so; but because the sun made the tent so
intolerably hot that there was no pleasure to be derived from staying in
bed any longer. Naturally after this we were very cross, which the
Skipper says all really pious people are on Sunday morning; and he
abused Esau shamefully, because the latter wanted the eggs buttered and
the Skipper wanted them fried. Esau laid down the axiom that ‘no
gentleman ever eats fried eggs,’ in a peculiarly offensive manner, and
proceeded further to make ill-natured remarks with reference to violet
ink; and the Skipper retorted with the observation, ‘Wish you’d brought
that anchovy paste.’ Esau: ‘Why?’ Skipper: ‘Because it’s just the stuff
to grease your boots with in a place like this; smells strongish, and
keeps the mosquitoes at a distance.’ Altogether we made ourselves as
disagreeable as possible to each other&mdash;just as we do in our happy
homes on the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page63" id = "page63">63</a></span>
Sabbath morn in England. Fortunately Sunday only comes once a week.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the Skipper devoted himself to the occupation of
greasing his boots and shaving, which he seems to do at the same time,
so that one brush may be used for both the soap and the grease; while
Esau did some washing.</p>

<p>We had some trouble in getting good firewood, for Sikkildals Vand is
more than three thousand feet above sea level, and consequently we were
above the region of pine forests, and had only the stunted birch and
juniper from which to obtain our supply. We divide the altitudes rather
differently from the system adopted by other great explorers. The lowest
belt is that of pine forests and strawberries, then comes the zone of
stunted birches, above that only juniper and bitter willow are found;
and the highest belt of vegetation contains only rocks,
reindeer-flowers, and moss, and then eternal snow.</p>

<p>Now birch trees do not make good firewood, for when they die they
appear to get water-logged, and never burn well. The juniper is the most
invaluable of all trees, for it will burn quite green; but at Sikkildals
Vand it is very scarce, and so it took us quite a long time to collect
enough dry wood to last our stay out, but it was done at last. We
carried one canoe across the spit of land between the two lakes, and in
it the Skipper went forth to get fish for the larder, while Esau took
the other canoe
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page64" id = "page64">64</a></span>
down the lower lake to get some milk from Sikkildals Sæter.</p>

<p>The scenery here is very fine. The lakes are narrow, and highish
mountains rise on each side: those on the south side had snow upon them,
though this would disappear before the end of the summer, as we are not
yet in the regions of perpetual snow; on the north side there is a very
remarkable mountain called Sikkildals Horn, with a perfectly
impracticable front of overhanging rock, very high and rugged. There was
a constant rumbling and booming proceeding from it, as rocks from time
to time broke off and came crashing down; but our tent&mdash;though
seemingly under this cliff&mdash;was well out of their reach. At the
further end of the upper lake we could see an apparently impassable
mountain ridge. Beyond this, about four miles further according to the
maps, was Besse Sæter, a&nbsp;farm, or ranch, only one day’s journey
from our final resting-place. How we were to cross that mountain with
our canoes and baggage, was a matter only to be determined by prophets
and other beings of a higher order of intelligence than ours. Our friend
Mr.&nbsp;B. thought it was almost impossible; the Skipper boldly
asserted that it <i>was</i> impossible, and requested to be allowed to
die here; while Esau, with the sanguine joyousness begotten of total
ignorance, said of course it could be managed. We determined to move to
the end of the lake the next day, and try the pass on the one
following&mdash;barring earthquakes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page65" id = "page65">65</a></span>
<p>Esau had a most interesting voyage. His fishing was not very
successful at first, and he paddled steadily on towards the Sæter,
overtaking a boat quite full of girls, dressed in the very picturesque
native costume which the people in these primitive regions still adhere
to, especially on Sundays. The girls about here are rather pretty than
otherwise, and these were a particularly good selection, and of course
all in their cleanest and smartest clothes for Sunday. They <i>would</i>
stop to watch him fishing, till he got quite shy, and gave up throwing
till they rowed&nbsp;on.</p>

<img src = "images/pic65.png" width = "537" height = "381"
alt = "Sæter Girls in a Boat on Sikkildals Lake"></p>

<p>Soon he came to a brood of pochards under the leadership of the old
duck, and spent half an hour trying to capture one by rapid paddling, in
which endeavour he was nearly but not quite successful.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page66" id = "page66">66</a></span>
There were a good many teal and pochards on the lower lake, and plenty
of sandpipers on the shores of the upper one.</p>

<p>At last he reached the Sæter, and found there all the girls of the
boat, and at least another boat-load and five or six
strangers&mdash;quite a crowd: possibly they had been having a church
service, but probably not, as they all seemed in the best of tempers,
and were most amiable.</p>

<p>He got the milk, and coming back tried a few casts, and found that
the fish were rising properly; the result was nineteen good trout in
about an hour and a half. We had not been catching many fish lately; so
after his return to camp we concluded that this was the hour and we were
the men to revel in a fiendish glut of capture. So there was a regular
stampede in that camp, and after dinner we <i>all</i> went out armed to
the teeth with rods and fly-books, and clothed in landing nets and Freke
bags, with our teeth firmly set and a bloodthirsty look in our eyes,
intending to struggle with the great trout in his native element or
perish in the attempt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock that night there might have been seen toiling
wearily back to camp under a cloudy sky and with a chilly blast
a-blowing, two forlorn youths, ‘sans’ fish, ‘sans’ hope, but still armed
to the teeth with the weapons of the chase.</p>

<p>However, we had now tried both lakes, and got some knowledge of their
capabilities. The upper one
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page67" id = "page67">67</a></span>
is, we think, the better of the two, but more difficult to catch fish
in. The Skipper got some in it to-day, and they were larger fish than
those of the lower lake, and a different sort, more like the silvery
trout of the Jotunfjeld, whereas the others are the ordinary brown or
yellow trout.</p>

<p>This afternoon Mr. B. and his wife with a friend came up in a boat to
see our camp, at which they seemed much pleased. We took them short
cruises in the canoes, showed them our various arrangements, and
endeavoured to be agreeable.</p>

<p>The friend was the manager of the government stud for this district,
and spoke English fairly. He told us that the government provides a
certain number of good stallions, which are turned out on the fjeld and
run with the peasants’ mares, and that they take great trouble to
provide the best that can be got, so as to improve the breed. He
considered that there are very decidedly good results.</p>

<h5>July 26.&mdash;</h5>

<p>A beautiful fishing morning, just beginning to blow up for rain. The
Skipper fished his way down to the Sæter for more provisions, and had
first-rate sport, catching twenty-two beautiful fish, mostly over a
pound. He had such an exciting time of it that lunch was forgotten till
three o’clock, a&nbsp;fact which spoke volumes for the excellence of the
sport, for we generally acquire a very keen appetite every three or four
hours so long as the sun is performing his daily duty (of standing still
while we circulate
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page68" id = "page68">68</a></span>
feebly round ourselves). He came back to the tent, presenting rather a
distended appearance, having stuffed most of his pockets full of
potatoes, and a packet of salt in his hat; and while with his right hand
he folded to his bosom a bottle of cream, and another of milk, in his
left he grasped a rod, a&nbsp;landing net and paddle, and the rest of
him was hung with fish. The Skipper objects to making two journeys where
only one is necessary.</p>

<p>Esau thinks that ‘flesh-meat’ is a necessary of life, so he took his
gun up the upper lake, and returned with the noble spoil of five
sandpipers which he had shot out of the canoe by creeping along the edge
of the lake, a&nbsp;most entertaining pastime.</p>

<p>There is an old ruined fisherman’s hut at our end of the lake, and
this had apparently been taken as a habitation by a family of stoats,
which Esau espied at their gambols on his return. Cartridges are
precious here, but the instinct of destruction of a stoat was too much
for him, and having chirped till two of them stood close together and a
third just behind, he fired into the crowd and mortally injured the lot.
Poor little things! It is rather a shame to kill them, for there is so
little game that they cannot do much harm, probably feeding chiefly on
mice and lemmings, which are very numerous; and they always look
uncommonly pretty playing about the rocks. No more graceful animal
exists than a stoat.</p>

<p>After dinner had been cooked and despatched we
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page69" id = "page69">69</a></span>
went forth to fish again, and had some good sport; but presently
lowering clouds settled down over the surface of the deep, mosquitoes
gathered round us in swarms, and a few spots of rain drove us home to
the snug retreat of the tent, where hidden away under the warmth of our
bedding we smoked in thoughtful silence, and gloated over the day’s
doings and our larder stocked with fishes.</p>

<h5>July 27.&mdash;</h5>

<p>The day commenced with showers, and as there are no inhabitants here
to whom we can give the surplus fish, we did not like to catch any
more&mdash;for it is against our principles to waste food wilfully,
woeful want being too near and probable a state to be trifled
with&mdash;consequently we determined to move on, but first to bake some
bread.</p>

<p>This, in a temporary camp, is done by putting the kneaded dough into
a tin pot made on purpose without solder; this pot is then placed in a
hole in the ground in which we have previously kept a good fire for
about half an hour; before putting the pot in, all the embers and ashes
are cleared out, and then raked back on to the top of the tin and all
round it, and a small fire is kept going on the top. If well managed
this bakes excellent bread in about twenty minutes, but of course it
requires considerable experience and care to turn out really
satisfactory bread. When we get to our permanent camp we shall make a
proper oven.</p>

<p>To-day, when we had baked successfully, packed up our things, and
were taking advantage of a break
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page70" id = "page70">70</a></span>
between the showers to start, we were hailed from the bank, and saw
there old Peter Tronhūus, the tenant of Besse Sæter (whither we are
going) and father of Jens Tronhūus, our former hunter, who is now
getting what we require in the shape of food, ponies, and men, and whom
we expect to meet at Besse Sæter. Peter had a great deal to tell us
about all our affairs, which seem to be prospering under Jens’ auspices.
He talks English very badly, so the interview lasted some time, and then
we pushed off and paddled straight away to the extreme end of the lake,
where we found an inferior place to pitch the tent, very damp and
unwholesome in appearance, sadly in need of sanitary inspection, but no
doubt good enough for one night. We fished with fly and minnow all the
way, but took nothing, there being a good deal of thunder round about;
but Esau shot some more sandpipers.</p>

<p>Our tent is pitched at the commencement of an extremely vague track,
which we believe to go over our mountain pass to Sjödals Vand
(pronounced Shoodals), and to-morrow we hope to follow its wanderings,
if two men and horses&mdash;with whom we have made an arrangement to
transport us&mdash;turn up. These two men and horses are the sole
inhabitants of this very thinly populated district, so that we are at
their mercy, and if they do not come we must inevitably die of
starvation after we have eaten all our provisions and candles.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page71" id = "page71">71</a></span>
<p>Late in the evening Herr B&mdash;&mdash; and a scientific friend who
had just come to stay with him, came down the mountain to our tent. They
had been for a short walking tour to Lake Gjendin&mdash;our future
goal&mdash;where it seems that a tourist’s hut of a superior sort has
lately been built, and at this hut several kinds of food are kept, such
as tinned meats and beer. B&mdash;&mdash; and his friend have therefore
been there shopping. The news of this hut is rather unpleasant to us,
for Gjendin was chosen chiefly for its wildness and remoteness from
civilisation, and now we are haunted with the idea that there may be
tourists, and consequently no fish or reindeer. On the other hand, it
has been erected so short a time that it can hardly have affected the
country round about yet, and it will certainly be convenient for us from
a commissariat point of view.</p>

<p>We were just beginning supper when they arrived, but they would not
stop, for which we were secretly glad, as there was only enough soup for
two; so we had a whisky ‘skaal’ (health-drinking) instead, and they went
on their way full of beans and benevolence, as Mr. Jorrocks
hath&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>We ‘whisky’ every one who turns up at camp, and as a rule they like
it. We are not much of drunkards ourselves, so we can afford to give it
to other people.</p>

<h5>July 28.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">Our</span> two men arrived while we were at
breakfast this morning, and brought two sleighs in the boat with them;
these they deposited on the shore, and then one of them departed into
some secret haunt of his own in search of a horse. The last we saw of
him was a wee dot struggling up over the mountain crest; and we began to
feel what a hopeless sort of task was before&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>When we had finished our breakfast there were certain remnants of
food, and these we offered to the other man, because he seemed to want
something to do. We left him in the tent with a frying-pan containing
two trout fried in butter, and a tin pot nearly full of soup. Some time
afterwards we looked in, and saw him eating greedily off his
knife-blade, and after a further interval we noticed that he had
finished; then we examined the culinary utensils out of which he had
been feeding, and found he had left the trout untouched, but the butter
they were fried in he had utterly consumed off the blade of his knife,
and also all the soup through the same medium. But there
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page73" id = "page73">73</a></span>
was not more than a gallon and a half of the latter, so we did not
grudge&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Apparently he was like a giant refreshed after his meal, and seizing
one canoe he carried it up to the top of the mountain, and then came
back for the other and did the same with it; after this he returned
again and borrowed our axe, saying he wanted to make the path better for
the sleigh. He disappeared among the stunted birches, and we heard him
chopping and slowly getting further up the track for about an hour. We
naturally supposed that he was clearing away trees that obstructed the
path, but when we came to traverse that path ourselves, soon afterwards,
we discovered that he had only been filling up holes in the road by
felling trees across it. Now a road that can be improved by this process
is in a very bad state and this one was decidedly improved.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page74" id = "page74">74</a></span>
<p>Just before we started an English tourist came down the mountain and
arranged with Siva (one of our men) to go down the lake in his boat. He
was the first of our fellow-countrymen whom we have seen since
Lillehammer, and proved to be the only one we met all through our trip
in the mountains.</p>

<p>After some time we perceived three dots wending their way down the
path again, and presently they arrived, proving to be our other man and
two extremely shaggy ponies; and after the complicated Norwegian harness
had been put on we began the ascent. The path was as bad as bad could be
for a short distance, but when the level was reached it became much
better than we had had hitherto; it was only the first climb up from the
lake that presented any difficulty. The canoes could only have been
transported as they were, on a man’s back.</p>

<p>It continued showery, but we had a very pleasant walk, and launched
our canoes on Sjödals Vand at about three o’clock. A&nbsp;short paddle
across the lake, not more than three quarters of a mile, and we were at
Besse Sæter.</p>

<p>Sjödals Vand is a long straggling lake, very much exposed to the
wind, and not in any way beautiful except for its wildness, as its
shores are almost treeless and rather flat. Its most remarkable
characteristic is the colour of its water, which is a light greenish
blue, like a starling’s egg, and stands out in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page75" id = "page75">75</a></span>
striking contrast against the yellow shore and dark mountain heights
which surround&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Besse Sæter is only three miles from Gjendin Vand&mdash;the haven
where we would be; and the snow-capped mountains, which have been
gradually getting nearer all the way from Olstappen, are now
magnificently towering above us on three sides.</p>

<p>The Sæter is a hut, built as they all are, entirely of wood, and only
inhabited during the summer months. The hut in which we are living is
not strictly speaking a sæter at all, but has been built for the
convenience of travellers, and the Tronhūus family are entrusted with
the duty of taking care of those who come hither while wandering about
this, the wildest and grandest part of Norway. The real sæter is a
larger building about a quarter of a mile from this hut, and higher up
the mountain. And further away still there is yet another building, or
collection of buildings, also called Besse Sæter.</p>

<p>Our hut has three rooms, two of which&mdash;a bedroom and
eating-room&mdash;are occupied at present solely by us: in the other
room dwell two girls, apparently guests of the Tronhūus. Peter Tronhūus
himself and his numerous family live in a one-roomed hut just opposite
this. At present the family appears to consist of two men, five women,
and two children, relationship to each other unknown.</p>

<p>Peter and his son Jens&mdash;who was with us on a former
expedition&mdash;are both away at present; the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page76" id = "page76">76</a></span>
latter engaged in procuring various articles for us, such as potatoes,
men, ponies, and dogs, about which we wrote to him from England; and he
is expected back to-morrow.</p>

<p>In spite of the crowd of people living here, everything is
beautifully clean and tidy, and our eating-room looks very nice, with
its floor always covered with fresh juniper sprays, and a cheerful fire
burning in that most charming of fireplaces, the primitive Norwegian
corner-hearth, which is being rapidly superseded everywhere by horrid
tall, black, iron stoves, that look like coffins set up on end, and
smell like flat-irons and rosin when they are lighted.</p>

<p>We shall have to make this place our home until Jens turns up; and we
are not at all sorry to do so, for they take the greatest trouble to
make us comfortable, and the trout, fladbrod, and coffee are simply
perfection. Besides, we are only a short day’s journey from Memurudalen,
where we intend to camp, and there is nothing to be gained by getting
there before August 1, the opening day of the reindeer season.</p>

<p>After supper we sallied out, the Skipper with rod, Esau with gun, to
see what we could catch. Esau landed on the marsh at the head of the
lake, to try and circumvent some duck he had descried; in this he
failed, but shot a greenshank, of which there were several flying
about.</p>

<p>The Skipper fished the river without success. Sjödals Vand is a fine
lake, but not much good for
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page77" id = "page77">77</a></span>
fishing, because of the great amount of netting that is carried on in
the summer by the dwellers in the Sæter; nevertheless there are good
fish in it, as we have seen many of two and three pounds weight, that
they have caught in the nets.</p>

<h5>July 29.&mdash;</h5>

<p>A friend of ours began the opening chapter of his virgin novel with
the words ‘It was a thoroughly cussèd morning towards the latter end of
July.’ The same applied exactly to this morning: but the arrival of Jens
encouraged us; and Esau walked outside to look at the sky; where,
thrusting his hands in his pockets and lodging an eye-glass in his eye,
he focussed the heavens generally, with a cruel, inquisitive stare; and
shaking his head knowingly, indulged in a prophecy concerning the
weather&mdash;‘that the wind now being in the west, there would be
continuous sunshine for three weeks at least.’ Then he walked in again,
and we all shivered over the fire.</p>

<p>Jens arrived at breakfast-time, and after greetings
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page78" id = "page78">78</a></span>
had been exchanged, reported all his achievements on our behalf. He had
secured for us a stalker, one Öla, a&nbsp;hewer of wood and drawer of
water, by name Ivar (his last office seems likely to be a sinecure, but
we can work him double at the first-mentioned employment), a&nbsp;horse,
and a sack of potatoes; all of which will arrive at Memurudalen in time
for August 1. We hoped for a dog for Ryper, but he had not been able to
get one.</p>

<a name = "pic78" id = "pic78">&nbsp;</a><br>
<img src = "images/pic78.png" width = "250" height = "163"
alt = "Ring Dotterel"></p>

<p>Esau is always bemoaning the law which prohibits him bringing dogs
from England; it is suspected that he has a large collection of useless
animals there, that he wishes to import into Norway and sell to the
guileless and unreflecting native. Unassisted by any of the canine
tribe, however, we have now accumulated what we call ‘a&nbsp;good larder
of bird-meat;’ for certain wild fowl were observed to-day to secrete
themselves in the marsh at the head of the lake, whither we followed
them with all our dread artillery, and we now have a lot of teal,
greenshanks, sandpipers, and a ring dotterel stowed away and engaged in
preparing themselves by decomposition for our
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page79" id = "page79">79</a></span>
consumption. Some of these birds are almost unknown to the table of the
ordinary Briton; but if he will consider that our daily food depends
entirely on what we shoot or catch, we hope, as the writers of books
say, ‘the kind reader will excuse’ the sandpipers and dotterel.</p>

<p>We were wet through on the marsh, and not at all sorry to return to a
comfortable fire in a warm room, instead of the streaming sides of a
cold and cheerless tent. Shooting as we did above our knees in water,
the rain did not make any appreciable difference in our great wetness.
After the point of saturation is past, we have discovered that the human
frame is as impervious to moisture (external) as a macintosh.</p>

<p>This summer so far has been remarkably wet and cold for Norway, but
we have now the inexpressible consolation of knowing that they are in
worse case at home; for we have received our first batch of letters and
papers from England, which have been a fortnight <i>en route</i>.</p>

<h5>July 30.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Prophets are without honour in these parts; they are also without
truth, honesty, or any good quality or proper feeling. This day is worse
than usual, and the good people here have been going about with blanched
cheeks, whispering with bated breath of a great flood which occurred in
the time of one Noah. We spent all the morning trying to teach the cows,
goats, and poultry to walk two and two in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page80" id = "page80">80</a></span>
case of any emergency arising, and the Skipper&mdash;who was engaged in
building what he called a Nark&mdash;was repeatedly coming into the
Sæter to ask how many yards there were in a cubit. However, at
lunch-time the land was still visible, so we sallied forth into the
marsh again, and secured some more teal; and then Esau went off in his
canoe after some scaup ducks on the lake; and brought home two, after
following them&mdash;according to his after-dinner account of the
struggle&mdash;for about six hours, while they swam, and flew, and
dived; and he paddled, and swore, and shot. They appear to have roamed
over the whole extent of this vast lake, seeking safety from his
unerring barrels. And he now points to a little hill, far below the
distant horizon, beneath which he affirms that he brought the last
victim to bay and slew him. He was absent on the expedition an hour and
a quarter; a&nbsp;canoe will go about five miles an hour; and the lake
is seven miles long. But we did not come out here to do arithmetic.</p>

<p>We settled not to go to Gjendin ourselves to-day, as the weather was
so very unfavourable, but we
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page81" id = "page81">81</a></span>
packed and despatched some of our luggage this evening, and purpose
following it to-morrow.</p>

<p>Before doing this we had a long interview with Jens Tronhūus, with
the main object of settling all accounts. Now a long interview between
three men who cannot speak two words of each other’s languages is a
somewhat intricate business, and would be decidedly amusing to
beholders. How we got through it is beyond the wit of man, but
nevertheless the fact remains that everything is beautifully arranged;
we thoroughly understand each other; both sides are satisfied; and we
concluded everything without the aid of that potent mediator, Whisky,
the Great and Good.</p>

<p>Besse Sæter grows upon one: the people are all so simple and kind,
and cook our food so well, that we shall be quite sorry to leave, even
though trout and reindeer are in prospect.</p>

<h5>July 31.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> morning appeared rather fine, so
we packed the rest of our baggage, and climbed the track which leads
over the shoulder of the mountain between Sjödals Vand and Gjendin
(pronounced ‘yendin’). It is rather steep, but nothing approaching the
villany of the tracks near Sikkildals Sæter, so the transit did not take
long, and we got to Gjendesheim about twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>Gjendesheim is a very good two-storied wooden building, with a large
dining-room, and about eight tiny cupboards of bedrooms; it has been
erected just where the Sjoa River runs out at the eastern extremity of
the lake, for the benefit of travellers, who can get food and lodging of
a sort there, and generally boats to take them up the lake.
Ragnild&mdash;the woman who presides over it&mdash;is very nice, kind,
and attentive, and talks English well. Her latter qualification hardly
gets fair play, as not many English people come here; and indeed the
Norwegians who visit the lake are not very numerous. From the book we
can only
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page83" id = "page83">83</a></span>
see two English names before us this year; and yet Gjendin is perhaps
the most beautiful, certainly the wildest and grandest lake in Norway,
and is well worth a visit from any tourist who has time at his
disposal.</p>

alt = "Our first View of Gjendin Lake"></p>

<p>It is eleven miles long; very deep; very <ins class = "correction"
title = ", invisible">blue,</ins> and on all sides rising sheer out of
the water for from 1,000 to 4,000 feet are vast black mountains with
snow-clad summits; for it lies in the very heart of the highest
mountains in Norway. It may not unfairly be likened to an unfrequented
and awfully desolate Lake of Lucerne.</p>

<p>At 3,200 feet altitude it is of course above the fir trees, and only
in a few sunny nooks along its sides can even stunted birches, juniper,
and willow
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page84" id = "page84">84</a></span>
earn a precarious living. It is at these places alone that there is any
exit from the lake; for along the greater part of its length there is no
level place large enough to pitch a tent; no vegetation except berries
and moss; and no possibility of scaling the frowning cliffs by which it
is surrounded. But there is a great fascination in such a scene; and
although its first appearance is almost repellent, every moment of
gazing seems to increase its beauty and awe-inspiring grandeur.</p>

<p>At lunch here a great event happened; we had Salon öl (bottled beer),
and immediately bought the whole remaining stock, consisting of six
bottles. These we degraded by packing with the inferior baggage in the
canoes, and commenced the final stage of our journey, or
voyage&mdash;whichever is the right term.</p>

<p>About two miles from Gjendesheim, on the south shore, we came to a
waterfall which runs out of a small lake lying a short distance away up
in the valley. At the mouth of this fall was a small neat hut in which a
Christiania professor had just taken up his abode for a few days’
stalking; we stopped a few minutes to talk to him, and then paddled on,
trying a few casts now and then until we came to Memurudalen&mdash;our
intended camp.</p>

<p>It is about halfway up the lake on the north shore, and is a very
pretty little valley, profusely supplied with edible berries, surrounded
by thick birch
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page85" id = "page85">85</a></span>
covert, and with more grass than we ever expected to find at this
altitude; but it is by far the most favourably situated bit of the
Gjendin shores, as it is sheltered from the cold winds and gets the sun
all day.</p>

<p>We found a remarkably nice level bit of grass, screened by a rocky
bank, and with what the Skipper called ‘a&nbsp;brattling brooklet’ in
front, about two hundred yards from the lake. There we pitched the tent
and made everything comfortable, but of course we shall not decide
whether to stay here or not until we have tested its capabilities as
reindeer ground.</p>

<p>Beyond the purling streamlet, and about thirty yards from our front
door, the Memurua River goes tearing down, the colour of dirty soap-suds
from the mud which is ground into it by the mighty Memuru Glacier,
whence it springs. This glacier is about three miles from us up the
valley, but not in sight from our tent; in fact, the hills are so steep
that we are quite shut in, and can see very little except the
snow-fjelds and peaks just opposite to us across the lake. These peaks
spring from the highest plateau in Norway, which has an altitude of
about 6,000 feet, and both the plateau and peaks are almost inaccessible
to the hunter, as it is a day’s work to climb them, and any one doing so
would probably have to pass the night on the top. This is annoying, for
it is a capital place for deer.</p>

<p>An ancient hunter, some years ago, spent a long
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page86" id = "page86">86</a></span>
time in conveying with incredible exertions to the top of the central
peak, materials out of which he constructed a windmill; then he
descended and never went near the place again, and his windmill scared
all the deer away from that table-land, so that they frequented places
where a man could get to them; and the cunning hunter was rewarded by
many ‘stor bocks’ (big bucks). But now the windmill has been destroyed
by time and weather, and we fear that the deer again roam there
unmolested and unscared.</p>

<h5>Sunday, August 1.&mdash;</h5>

<p>It is our custom to rise on this day singing, ‘Come, rouse ye, then,
my merry, merry men, for it is our opening day,’ but on this occasion it
would not have been appropriate. We were not at all merry, because it
was Sunday, and raining; we were frozen in the night, our men and
potatoes have not come, and altogether we could see nothing to be merry
about, especially as the opening day having fallen on a Sunday, we did
not feel justified in going out to pursue.</p>

<p>So we devoted ourselves to the pleasures of the table. Last night we
had dotterel and sandpipers for dinner, this morning greenshanks, which
are very good birds indeed. There was also a large brew of a meritorious
composition known as Skoggaggany soup; the name is a little difficult to
<ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘pronouce’">pronounce</ins>, but the soup does not taste anything like
it; it is merely the Norwegian for a scaup duck. In England people have
been known to call scaups unfit for food, but here,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page87" id = "page87">87</a></span>
under the perfectly awful appetites that we have developed, the
Skoggaggany soup has very little chance.</p>

<p>After trying unsuccessfully to catch fish, we walked up the valley
after lunch to look for a hut which is marked on the Ordnance map, and
to see if there were any better camping-ground than the place we chose
yesterday. We saw some beautiful reindeer ground, but could not find the
hut or a camp.</p>

alt = "Two of our Retainers: Ivar and his Pony"></p>

<p>On our return we perceived two men loafing about the tent, who we
naturally concluded were thieves and murderers, and the Skipper hurried
on to do battle with them to the death for the possession of our
greatest treasure, the Salon öl. But on his arrival the robbers did not
fly, but stood and stared with their hands in their pockets; so he
lifted his hat and said, ‘Öla?’ (for of course he might have been a Dook
in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page88" id = "page88">88</a></span>
disguise); and one of them replied, ‘Ja;’ and cordiality being thus
established, produced the sack of potatoes and the cook, like a
conjuring trick, from somewhere behind him, out of his hat or coat
tails.</p>

<p>Then we went into all kinds of details with him about his and Ivar’s
wages, which he did not understand, and he replied at great length in
Norsk, which we did not understand, and so the interview concluded to
the gratification of all concerned. Öla is a big good-looking man,
rather too much of a gentleman, we fear: but Ivar is without doubt a
perfect ass, and will never be able to do anything in the way of
cookery, except perhaps boil a potato, and even in that enterprise we
consider it would be six to four on the potato.</p>

<h5>August 2.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> Skipper won the toss (he always
does, chiefly because the device on Norwegian coins is ‘sorter
indifferent like,’ and when Esau has called heads or tails, he looks at
it carefully, and gravely declares it to be the opposite), and was away
eight hours wandering about the mountains without seeing a living
creature except two buzzards, and hardly any ‘spoor.’ He returned to
camp very tired and rather cross, to find a <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘delicions’">delicious</ins> meal nearly ready
cooked by Esau, for the man whom we ironically call the cook has gone to
fetch his horse, for which we are to pay 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> a day as
long as we have it. The cook’s wages are to be 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a
day, and those of the stalker 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> We consider the
latter cheap at that rate. He is a very tall man; very big, very heavy,
and very bearded, and we hire the whole of him for the trifling sum
above stated.</p>

<p>Besides cooking the dinner, Esau had been employed in rigging up the
waggon-sheet as a continuation of the sleeping tent by planting an
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page90" id = "page90">90</a></span>
upright pole securely in the ground in front of the door, and connecting
its top with the old tent by a birch tree ridge pole: it thus makes a
very convenient place for all our large stores, and gives us much more
room in the tent. We had expected the men to sleep in it, but they
prefer living in a wretched little stone dog-kennel, which looks as if
fleas would swarm in it, and has been built by drovers, or some other
dirty people, for their lodging when they chance to come here: it is
about 200 yards from our tent, and, as the men prefer it, it is very
convenient for&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>The ground that the Skipper tried to-day seemed a first-rate reindeer
fjeld; this means an uneven tract of mountain country, too high for
vegetation, except occasional reindeer flowers and patches of gentian,
but not high enough to be entirely covered with perpetual snow: this
fjeld&mdash;where it is not snow&mdash;is made of rocks large and small,
from the size of a haystack to that of road metal, some of them firm,
but mostly loose, jagged, and sharp; the winter snow and frost leave
them in this condition by continually splitting and re-splitting them:
they are dark grey in colour, and at a distance look almost black.</p>

<p>What the reindeer can find attractive in such a place, possibly some
one can tell; we cannot. There is apparently nothing for any beasts of
the field to eat up there; but if you do happen to find deer before they
see you, they are certain to be feeding, and Esau thinks they are eating
the rocks; but the Skipper says
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page91" id = "page91">91</a></span>
it cannot be so, and inclines more to the theory that they feed on their
‘young,’ like tame rabbits, or possibly on their own blood, like the
pelican of the wilderness. As for the reindeer flower, which is supposed
to be their staff of life, it averages about half a stalk to the square
acre, but possibly it is possessed of many highly nutritious qualities,
and a little of it goes a long way. Anyhow, they thrive on their food,
whatever it may be; they are always very fat, and uncommonly good to eat
when you chance to slay one.</p>

<p>After dinner we tried all this portion of the lake for fish without
success, and coming back received the awful intelligence from Öla that
there are no fish in any parts of Gjendin except the extreme ends, and
the waterfall where Professor N&mdash;&mdash; is living. This is a
dreadful blow to us, for we always count upon fishing as our main
employment, and fish as our staple food; and if we cannot get any here
we shall have to leave. At present we have some which we brought with us
from Sjödals, but when they are exhausted there will be a mutiny in this
camp unless sport of some kind presents itself.</p>

<h5>August 3.&mdash;</h5>

<p>A curious accident happened to-day; there was no rain. We have in
vain tried to account for this phenomenon, and can only fall back on the
somewhat unsatisfactory theory that it is all used up. Esau went after
deer on the Rus Vand side, and came back very tired to dinner without
having seen
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page92" id = "page92">92</a></span>
any, but reported fresh tracks; he was full of the glorious view that
the fine day had given him. He had been close above the Memuru Glacier,
which is a very large one, and stretching beyond it as far as the eye
can reach is a sea of snow mountains, most of them peak-shaped, but some
domes or irregular precipices with immense glaciers lying between them,
and here and there the greenish-blue waters of a lake distantly gleaming
in the sunlight.</p>

<p>It is curious to note how the north and east sides of every peak are
torn and ragged, with huge masses of rock riven from them by the action
of the weather, while on the south and west they are comparatively
regular.</p>

<p>The Skipper spent the day in camp, completing the erection of the
outside tent. Our abode is now sumptuous in the extreme, as the new wing
holds all the lumber which formerly blocked up our bedroom. There was
some discussion as to whether we should call it the ‘Criterion Annexe,’
until we remembered that there are always policemen about that
celebrated building, and this decided us not to do&nbsp;so.</p>

<h5>August 4.&mdash;</h5>

<p>The Skipper went on to Bes Hö stalking. This is a high mountain 7,400
feet above sea level. It is close to us, between Gjendin and Rus Vand,
and is one of the dome-shaped species.</p>

<p>The Norwegians call their mountains either ‘Tind,’ which means a
cone, or ‘Hö,’ a&nbsp;round top; ‘Piggen,’ a&nbsp;peak rather more
jagged than a Tind; ‘Horn,’ apparently
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page93" id = "page93">93</a></span>
one steep side and one more gradual; and ‘Kampen,’ apparently a rough
hill with nothing striking about its shape. Most of the mountains round
here are Tinden, the finest being Memurutind, Skagastolstind, and
Glitretind, the last over 8,000 feet, only surpassed in height by
Galdopiggen, which, though in sight of us, is beyond our reach.</p>

<img src = "images/pic93.png" width = "244" height = "500"
alt = "The Skipper returns to Camp disgusted with life"></p>

<p>From Bes Hö the Skipper got a good view between the storms of Gjendin
lying encircled by its enormous steep black banks of snow-capped
mountains,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page94" id = "page94">94</a></span>
the whole of its eleven miles of length being visible at once. Its
colour is a creamy greenish blue, caused by the snow-water which comes
straight into the lake by scores of torrents, which collect it from the
various glaciers. The Skipper, who is always bubbling over with poetic
similes, said it looked like a cupful of very blue milk in a crease of
brown paper; but, beautiful as this idea is, who can take any pleasure
in scenery without a little, ever so little, sport to flavour it withal?
Certainly not the Skipper; so he came back from his long tramp disgusted
with life, and longing to find that Esau had played the fool in his
absence, so that he might be able to pick a quarrel with him.
Unfortunately Esau was provokingly amiable, and had been performing acts
of virtue, such as making soup, improving the tent, and swearing at the
cook the whole day, so that the seething volcano of the Skipper’s temper
had to content itself without an eruption. We did manage to get up an
approach to a row about the Memuru Glacier, which the Skipper had
visited to-day: he described its beauty and the extraordinary blue of
the ice, where the large crevasses near its lower end gave glimpses of
its real formation&mdash;for of course it is covered thickly with snow
except just where it begins to break up. Then he went on to say how
curious it was to think that this huge mass, covering square miles of
ground, is always moving onwards, and that no more powerful agent exists
for altering the arrangement of the earth’s crust than
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page95" id = "page95">95</a></span>
that cold, placid field of ice. Esau said it did <i>not</i> move. He
watched it for half an hour yesterday and it never stirred, and he even
pushed it with his stick without the smallest effect.</p>

<p>It is impossible to argue with a man of that kind.</p>

<p>Tyndall and Geikie being disposed of, we had a discussion in the tent
over the map, with the result that we determined to leave the camp for
four days in charge of Ivar; and we and Öla would go to Gjendesheim, and
live there, and drink beer, and catch fish until the 8th, when we
calculated that John ought to arrive; and we hope by that time some
reindeer will have sought safety from other guns by flying to the
sheltering embrace of our fjeld.</p>

<p>We always do our baking just before bedtime, when the men have gone
to their hutch, and in a permanent camp it soon gets reduced to a
certainty. We prefer milk to water for mixing with the flour, as it
makes the bread crisper and shorter, and it does not matter how sour the
milk is. This is most providential, as we have generally plenty of sour
milk. We send twice a week to Besse Sæter, distant about eight miles,
and the long journey does not agree with the milk, so that it is
generally turned before it arrives here.</p>

<p>Another important article of food is soup, of which we have several
varieties. When made of scaup duck, it is&mdash;as already
mentioned&mdash;called Skoggaggany
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page96" id = "page96">96</a></span>
soup; but our present brew is ‘gipsy soup,’ which is made from potatoes,
fishes chopped into small lumps, a&nbsp;square of ‘Kopf’s compressed
vegetables’&mdash;a most invaluable article&mdash;and all the bones from
the birds that we happen to be using. We never empty the pot, but keep
adding water and bones as fast as we consume it, and it simmers by the
fire all day. But when times are very bad, and we have no meat, and are
living on fish, our soup is then called ‘prairie soup,’ and is composed
of every scrap that we can collect&mdash;fish-bones; bacon; potatoes;
milk; dandelion, and sorrel; bread, and biscuits: and whenever it
develops any unusual flavour, we look suspiciously round to see if that
boot-lace or candle-end is missing, or if any of the tent-pegs have been
newly whittled. It is always very good, and we call it ‘prairie’ because
of the dandelion, which is a prairie flower.</p>

<p>There is yet one more kind, known as ‘Argonaut soup,’ the recipe of
which was introduced from America by the Skipper; but our resources have
never yet been so low that we could not make something better than
this.</p>

<p class = "center"><i>Recipe for Argonaut Soup.</i></p>

<p>Take a pail of water and wash it clean. Then boil it till it is brown
on both sides. Pour in one bean. When the bean begins to worry, prepare
it to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page97" id = "page97">97</a></span>
simmer. If the soup will not simmer it is too rich, and you must pour in
more water. Dry the water with a towel before you put it in. The drier
the water, the sooner it will brown. Serve hot.</p>

<h5>August 5.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">Such</span> a lovely morning at last that
we were quite tempted to stay, but nobly stuck to our resolve, heaped
everything we possessed except rods, guns, and a change of raiment, into
the inner tent, and covered them with a ground-sheet; then packed the
selected weapons into the canoes, and sailed from these inhospitable
shores.</p>

<p>Not far from camp we saw some fish rising under a cliff, and though
it was a dead calm, and the sun as bright as sun could be, we stopped to
try for them.</p>

<p>Esau soon tired of casting, and mentioning that ‘if <i>he</i> could
not catch those fish no one could,’ paddled off to make a formal call on
the Professor, and ask if he had got any deer.</p>

<p>The Skipper persevered, and was rewarded with two fish weighing about
three pounds, and the most perfect fish for shape and condition that we
have ever seen. This was an important event for us, for it entirely
demolished Öla’s theory of the non-existence of fish here, and gave us
new hope for the future, especially
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page99" id = "page99">99</a></span>
as the weather has been so bad all the time until now, that we should
hardly have caught any even if they swarmed.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "pic99" id = "pic99">&nbsp;</a><br>
<img src = "images/pic99.png" width = "479" height = "406"
alt = "Throwing for a Rise"></p>

<p>The Skipper is devoted to the sport of ‘throwing for a rise,’ which
he thinks the perfection of fishing. It can hardly be pursued with
success anywhere but in Norway, for only there do fish seem to rise
greedily after a constant succession of fine, hot, sunny days, with
never a drop of rain or cat’s-paw of wind.</p>

<p>The great charm to him is the extreme delicacy required. You
<i>must</i> put on your thinnest cast, your smallest fly, and throw your
lightest; and unless you throw a very long line you have not a chance
for the beggar. Then, if he comes at you, you can see him
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page100" id = "page100">100</a></span>
through the calm clear water, and watch the whole performance. You get a
rather better chance where two fish are rising close together, as there
is some jealousy and competition between them, and each of them is
likely to rush at your fly without sufficient meditation, lest the other
one may get it first.</p>

<p>The Skipper has studied fish from a moral point of view, and says
that they are very much like men: and he invariably turns his knowledge
of their habits to good account. Throwing for a rise&mdash;in a lake
like this, where the fish run large&mdash;on a calm bright day is
decidedly his forte; his motto in fishing being ‘far and fine.’ Whereas
Esau shines more in a rapid stream than elsewhere.</p>

<p>The latter had a great time with the Professor, who he said was a
capital fellow, and gave him whisky which they drank ‘to better sport;’
and they both agreed that there were no reindeer to be found in the
district at present, and the Professor said he was going further north
if matters did not mend speedily.</p>

<p>After the fishing and visiting were concluded, we hoisted sails of
primitive construction, formed of a rug and a landing net, which, with a
fair wind, soon brought us to Gjendesheim.</p>

<p>We think this wind is the chief cause of our misfortune. When we were
in these parts before, the wind was always against us whenever we
journeyed; and in that year we had first-rate sport, both in shooting
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page101" id = "page101">101</a></span>
and fishing. But this time the wind has always been with us, and we pay
for the luxury by getting no shooting and not much fishing. ‘No
mahtterr&mdash;a time will come.’</p>

<p>After food the Skipper with Öla went over to Leirungen&mdash;a small
lake about three quarters of a mile distant. Öla carried his canoe, and
did not like the job. It gives us considerable satisfaction to make Öla
do any work, he is so abominably lazy.</p>

<p>It seemed that the tide of luck was already changing, as both he and
Esau&mdash;who was throwing a fly on the river nearer home&mdash;brought
in a few nice fish.</p>

<p>Just before bedtime there arrived at the rest-house three Norwegian
tourists of the sterner sex, and a young lady the daughter of one of
them. The father was a barrister, and the other two were the Lord Chief
Justice of what they imagine to be Common Pleas, and a very thin,
dried-up student of theology. They all talked English, and the young
lady seemed anxious to practise the language.</p>

<h5>August 6.&mdash;</h5>

<p>After a gay breakfast Esau went his way to fish, while the
Skipper&mdash;ever devoted to the fair sex&mdash;offered Miss Louise a
cruise in his canoe.</p>

<p>The sun shone brightly as they moved over the quiet waters, and the
fish were too lazy to rise, but lay idly thoughtful at the bottom of the
lake. The Skipper was very polite to his charming companion, as she sat
in a state of blissful comfort amongst the rugs which he had placed for
her in the bows of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page102" id = "page102">102</a></span>
boat; and no sound was heard but the gentle plash of the paddle in the
water, and in the distance the Sæter girl calling home the grazing
cows.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "pic102" id = "pic102">&nbsp;</a><br>
<img src = "images/pic102.png" width = "526" height = "414"
alt = "The Skipper takes Miss Louise for a Cruise at Gjendesheim"></p>

<p>But presently a cloud gathered over the mountain tops, and thunder
was heard rolling among the distant hills; a&nbsp;gentle breeze stirred
the surface of the water, and every lazy fish woke up to seek his food.
The Skipper longed to go and fetch his rod. He hinted at this, and at
last became impatient; but, by Jove! Miss Louise would not go. There she
sat and prattled on, charming, pleased with herself, and utterly
unmindful of the rising fish and the fretting Skipper. Time kept passing
on, till at length her father brought relief by appearing on the shore
to call her in to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page103" id = "page103">103</a></span>
dinner; but then the Skipper had to get his food too, and when he had
bolted the humble but indigestible crust and cheese, and rushed out
again to seize his rod, he found it too late, as the lake was now dark
with clouds, and the fish had left off rising.</p>

<p>Soon after lunch it began to rain like a waterfall, and Esau arrived
with a lot of fish&mdash;spoils from the Leirungen Ocean, and the result
of Spartan indifference to the attractions of woman. There is a shining
moral in this tale.</p>

<p>He also brought a romance about a rainbow, which had been so close to
him that the two ends met at his feet. The rain hereabouts is very
thick.</p>

<p>The evening proved too wet to fish, and this indefatigable young lady
captured Esau, and after exhausting all the ordinary topics of
conversation, began to show him every kind of puzzle that the mind of
man ever conceived, puzzles with coins and puzzles with string; and she
puzzled him with matches, and paper, and corks, till the poor young man
became perfectly dazzled, and only longed for bedtime to put an end to
his misery. Then she asked him riddles, first English and then French.
The Skipper, apparently deeply interested in a book at the further end
of the room, overheard Esau’s answer to the first French riddle; it was
‘Je le donne en haut.’</p>

<p>Presently, when they went up to bed, the Skipper said, ‘I didn’t
quite follow your answer to that first riddle of hers. You said, “Je le
donne en haut.”’
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page104" id = "page104">104</a></span>
‘Oh! ah!’ answered Esau. ‘That’s idiomatic French, and means a good deal
that you don’t understand; I&nbsp;always use it to gals, especially when
they’re pretty.’ The Skipper coughed, and turned into his bedroom
without saying ‘good night.’</p>

<p>We have always been told that the Norwegian aristocracy particularly
dislike the English sportsman in Norway. We think, therefore, that our
fair friend cannot have been of very noble lineage. But she was very
nice and rather pretty.</p>

<p>She left early next morning, and Esau said he was glad she was gone,
as the Skipper was getting entangled with her.</p>

<h5>August 7.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">We</span> began another day by catching a
beautiful bag of fish, and about midday were just starting to shoot our
way over to Besse Sæter, when a man came in sight stumbling down the
mountain track towards the rest-house. He was red and sunburnt, with a
beard of about three days’ growth. He was coatless, collarless, and
apparently exhausted. On his nearer approach we saw he was an
Englishman, and presently when a few yards from us we
recognised&mdash;John! Not the smart young beau we have always seen him
in London; no longer the devotee to society and his club, but an almost
unrecognizable John, so sunburnt and hot and hungry. Formal greetings
were exchanged: ‘Dr. Livingstone, I&nbsp;presume?’ ‘Mr. Stanley,
I&nbsp;believe?’ and we rushed into each other’s embrace.</p>

<p>Then we besought him to refresh himself on fladbrod, milk, and
coffee; which he did, largely. After this he became calm enough to give
us a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page106" id = "page106">106</a></span>
brief summary of his adventures since he left England.</p>

<p>He had done the journey from Christiania in very quick time, and had
left all his luggage twenty miles behind at Hind Sæter, which is the
nearest place to us to which wheeled vehicles can get. From thence he
had started at five o’clock this morning. How he found the way is a
marvel, but by great good fortune he met a man when he was about three
miles out of the track, who put him right; otherwise he would probably
never have arrived anywhere.</p>

<p>He has brought additional stores for the camp, as arranged before we
left England, and we had left a note in Christiania asking him to call
at the shop in Vaage, and try to get a small stove for the tent, or at
any rate find out the price of one. Vaage is our nearest village, about
fifty miles distant.</p>

<p>When John arrived there, seeing the shop as he drove past, he
descended from his cariole and entered. The shop was full of people
buying all the necessaries of life; for in these villages there is only
one shop, which is a general store for everything. John was a little
confused at his first experience of a Norwegian shop, but at last pulled
himself together, and seeing a stove standing in the middle of the room,
intended for heating the place, he walked up to it, and stroking it
gently with his hand, looked round at the people generally and remarked,
‘Hvor meget’ (How much)? Dead silence not unmingled with awe followed
this
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page107" id = "page107">107</a></span>
observation; for those simple rustics thought there was a maniac among
them. This perplexed John, and as everybody was staring at him, and he
began to find himself in a remarkably tight place, he concluded to make
another remark, so asked in Norsk, ‘Have you any whisky?’ The
storekeeper having no licence looked horrified, and said, ‘Nei.’ So John
pursued his advantage by inquiring, ‘Have you any aquavit?’ ‘Nei’ was
again the answer, and an ominous whisper of ‘<ins class = "norway" title
= "lensmand, now written -mann">landsmand</ins>’ (the policeman) was
plainly audible. John thought he had asked enough about stoves to quiet
his conscience, and guessed it was time to quit that shop. So rapidly
regaining his cariole, he vanished before any of the crowd had made up
their minds what to&nbsp;do.</p>

<p>We kept to our plan of going to Besse Sæter, starting as soon as John
had finished his lunch, and got several teal and a greenshank on the
way. On one little bit of water we spied three teal near the bank, and
having both together made a most skilful stalk, got them all.</p>

<p>Arriving at Besse Sæter we found one of the two rooms occupied by two
Swedish ladies, who were travelling about by themselves for the sake of
their health. One of them spoke English well, and told us they had been
up several of the high mountains round, and intended to wander about all
the summer.</p>

<p>We three had to be content with the other room, and two beds; odd man
out for the whole one.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page108" id = "page108">108</a></span>
Those who only had half a bed reported it rather a crowd in the
morning.</p>

<h5>Sunday, August 8.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Our object in coming to Besse Sæter was to break the journey to a
place called Rus Vand, where a Norwegian owns a lake and hut: it is
distant about two hours’ walk from Besse Sæter, and we had a letter of
introduction to Mr. Thomas, the owner, which we were anxious to deliver,
so as to obtain leave to fish in the lake, the western end of which
comes to within walking distance of our camp in Memurudalen; and the
fishing is remarkably good.</p>

<p>Therefore this morning we started to clamber up the steep mountain
side that has to be crossed between Besse Sæter and Rus Vand, and
skirting the shores of Bes Vand&mdash;which lies on a small plateau at
the summit&mdash;we soon found ourselves scrambling down over the loose
stones, and through the willow scrub that covers the uneven slopes
approaching the east end of the lake.</p>

<p>From our side of the river&mdash;when we reached its banks, while a
boat was crossing to fetch us&mdash;we saw several men, and a couple of
English-looking setters, a&nbsp;pointer, and a target fixed up about 200
yards from the huts, so that the place presented a very sporting
appearance.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas received us very kindly, and at once gave us permission to
fish in his lake. Both he and his wife spoke English perfectly, as did
another lady
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page109" id = "page109">109</a></span>
staying with them, and as most emphatically did <i>not</i> another
sportsman also living there.</p>

<p>These two ladies and two gentlemen were all living in a little
two-roomed hut, each room being about nine feet square, and the doorway
about five feet high and two wide; the gentlemen’s bedroom being also
the kitchen. How the ladies managed to turn themselves out in such
faultless apparel was a mystery, but it was done, for we
saw&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>It is a very plucky thing for ladies to come up here and live for a
month, even now when there is a wheel-road (of a sort) to within fifteen
miles, but the same thing was done by English ladies ten years ago, when
there was no road nearer than forty miles. Are their names not written
in the chronicles which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page110" id = "page110">110</a></span>
adorn the walls of the hut, and carved on the profile fishes which
decorate the floor?</p>

<p>In the other hut&mdash;which is little more than a boat&mdash;there
are living Jens Tronhūus, our old stalker; ‘Siva,’ the man who carried
our canoes up the mountain at Sikkildal, and another native, also the
dogs; besides bottles and churns, grindstones, pack-saddles, saws, axes,
and all the other heterogeneous articles which accumulate in a place of
this kind. It looked full.</p>

<p>We found the party just sitting down to breakfast after a rather
unsettled night, as they had been roused about half-past two in the
morning by some one hammering at the door, and found it was a young
Norwegian, named, let us say, Coutts, who was making a walking tour, and
was more or less lost. They succoured him with coffee and other
refreshments and sent him on his way with Jens to guide him. Coutts’s
intention was to struggle on to Besse Sæter, but we had seen nothing of
him there.</p>

<p>We stayed some time at the huts, talking and looking at all the
memorable objects that were there under our <i>régime</i> (as we had
occupied these huts and had the fishing to ourselves two years
previously). There was Esau’s celebrated ‘biggest trout whatever was
seen,’ carved on the floor; the Skipper’s favourite cast, and the ice
safe that we cunningly devised and constructed in the lower hut. The
Thomas’s are in even worse case than we, for like us they have seen
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page111" id = "page111">111</a></span>
no deer, and they have so many more mouths to feed. However, they have
any quantity of fish, for Rusvasoset is as good a place as the Sjoa at
Gjendesheim, which is saying a great deal.</p>

<p>About one we commenced the homeward journey. Two of Jens’ sisters had
come with us, nominally to see their brother, but really&mdash;John
asserted&mdash;for the purpose of flirting with <i>him</i>. He was
extremely polite to one of them&mdash;though of course he could not
speak to her&mdash;and would insist on carrying her shawl and other
impediments; and he confided to us afterwards that ‘women were generally
a good deal taken by that sort of mute homage.’ She was a dear little
girl, and we called her the ‘Sæter darlen;’ which we believe to be the
only Norwegian pun we ever attempted.<a class = "star" name = "tag4" id
= "tag4" href = "#note4">*</a></p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a class = "star" name = "note4" id = "note4" href = "#tag4">*</a>
John said this pun might be elucidated with advantage to the British
public, as he did not believe any one could possibly see it. Who cares?
Down it goes, and we can assure any one who likes to wrestle with it
that it is something very good indeed.</p>

<p>The walk home to Gjendesheim is a long one, and although it was
Sunday Esau insisted on making a détour over the marsh with his gun, as
he said he had lost his knife there yesterday and wanted to look for it.
He arrived late at Gjendesheim with a satisfied air on his face; without
his trusty steel, but with his pockets thrust full of too trustful teal,
that had adventured themselves within his reach.</p>

<p>At Gjendesheim we found the young Norwegian who had roused up the
Thomas’s at Rus Vand, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page112" id = "page112">112</a></span>
perceived that he was not without some peculiarities of character.
Although the weather was as wet and cold as weather could be, he was
attired in a suit of white duck clothes like an English mechanic; even
his hat was of white duck, and Esau declared afterwards that his boots
were made of the same material; that he had a cigar-case and cigars of
it, and ordered white ducks for his dinner. The appearance of his head
caused us to be very anxious about any little articles of value that we
had about us, for it looked as if it had been shaved all over about two
days previously to our making his acquaintance. He looked very strong,
tough, and active, and no doubt was so, for he had just performed a most
extraordinary walking feat. He is going over all the Jotun Mountains by
himself, and yesterday morning he started from a place an unknown number
of miles away at 6 <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span> He walked all
day and all night, till it got dark, at which time he was somewhere near
Glitretind, in a country he had never seen, with only a vague notion of
where he wanted to get to and a pocket compass to do it with. The
country about there is perfectly awful to walk over even by day; but he
kept at it through the dark, following a torrent up till he crossed the
watershed, and following another torrent down till he got to Rus Vand,
and staggered into the hut there at 2.30 <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span> almost fainting, for he had had nothing to eat
all day: true, he might have got fladbrod at the sæters during the day,
but he said
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page113" id = "page113">113</a></span>
he did not care for fladbrod: certainly, he had plenty of chocolate in
his knapsack, but he was tired of chocolate. At Rus Vand he got some
coffee, as Thomas told us; and then he walked over the mountain with
Jens to Besse Sæter, intending to sleep there: but we were snoring at
our ease in all the beds of Besse Sæter, and he hated sleeping on
floors, so he walked on again to Gjendesheim, arriving there at
half-past five this morning.</p>

<p>Then he produced his knapsack, which he said weighed twenty-five
lbs.: it seemed to be chiefly filled with packets of most delicious
chocolate, some of which he gave&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>We thought him a first-rate fellow, but certainly a little peculiar.
He has been all over the world, and is great at natural history, having
stuffed many birds in foreign countries for the museum at
Christiania.</p>

<p>The Skipper had the next room to his, and told us that at bedtime he
washed himself all over, cleaned his teeth, and brushed his hair: he
then stayed in bed till eleven o’clock next morning, when he rose and
went through the whole performance again. Now we did not mind him
washing, or brushing his teeth; we even respect him for doing it; but
brushing his hair was a simple insult to common sense, and a wicked
waste of time; for not a bristle on his head&mdash;whether hair,
moustache, or beard&mdash;was more than an eighth of an inch long, and
all of it was much stiffer than any hair-brush yet made. It was
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page114" id = "page114">114</a></span>
suggested that perhaps he was only combing his hair-brush with his head;
and with this explanation we had to rest content.</p>

<p>We luxuriated on meat to-night, for they have actually caught and
killed a sheep.</p>

<p>We fish with considerable success now at every odd moment of the day,
as the canoes are moored to the shore, not six yards from the house; and
it takes no time to get into them and push out into the deep lake, or
hover about the brink of the long rapids where the lake begins to be a
river.</p>

<span class = "subhead">BACK TO CAMP.</span></h3>


<h5>August 9.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> morning was again very wet, but
we are men of great decision and firmness; what our friends call
‘obstinate’ if they are civil, and ‘pig-headed’ when they want to be
disagreeable, as friends usually&nbsp;do.</p>

<p>Therefore we started for the camp after lunch: that is to say, the
Skipper and Esau started, as John remained to await the arrival of his
baggage, for which Ivar had been despatched. At present his wardrobe is
not very extensive, and he will perhaps be more comfortably fixed after
the arrival of his valise. He has one coat, one flannel shirt without
collar, one pair of trousers, socks, and boots, one pipe, one cap; one
fishing rod, line, and fly-book; one watch-chain, and a newspaper of
July&nbsp;23.</p>

<p>About two miles from Gjendesheim on the north side of the lake there
is an apparently perpendicular cliff, half a mile long and over 1,000
feet high: this is called the Beseggen, and at the top of it lies Bes
Vand, so close to the edge of the cliff that it seems
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page116" id = "page116">116</a></span>
impossible to believe that the lake is 1,000 feet above Gjendin, with
nothing but a narrow strip of rock to hold it within its bounds, and yet
the books say it is so, and we always believe anything we find in a
book. The cliff looks perfectly unscaleable, but we believe it has been
descended twice by an Englishman who used to live here, and once by a
Norwegian youth.</p>

<p>Bes Vand is so high that fish will not live in it; the professional
liars of these parts say it freezes solid every winter, and kills any
that have been put into it. It is a little difficult to believe this
statement, as it is a large and deep lake; but John says that a man who
will believe a guide-book can believe anything; so we all do our best to
swallow it (the statement, not the lake; we have hardly enough whisky to
make the latter palatable).</p>

<p>Gjendin is liable like all mountain lakes to be suddenly visited by
squalls, so that we generally like to paddle pretty near the side, but
on this voyage it was not safe to do so; for under the influence of the
rain, which was coming down as if it had never done so before, stones
and boulders were rattling and crashing down the sides of the lake, and
plunging into it, in a most alarming manner; and as far as we could see,
the steep black rocks were thickly streaked with white lines, denoting
torrents rushing down in places where ordinarily none were to be
seen.</p>

<p>Just as we were passing the Beseggen, a dull
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page117" id = "page117">117</a></span>
boom like that of a distant cannon was heard, and looking up we could
see far above our heads a huge spout of muddy water shoot out from the
cliff, carrying with it masses of stone and <i>débris</i> of all sorts;
evidently some bank had given way under the increased pressure of this
enormous rainfall. We thought for one brief moment that it might be Bes
Vand let loose on us, for even in fine weather it can always be seen
leaking through fissures in the rock, so narrow is the division between
the two lakes; but we did not stop to ascertain where it came from.</p>

<p>It soon became necessary to land and empty the canoes, by reason of
the heavy rain, the bottom boards being completely under water, though
we had only been afloat for half an hour.</p>

<p>Just before we got to Memurudalen the sun came out; Esau had a chase
after a black-throated diver that came up from a dive quite close to his
canoe, and then we both fell to fishing and got several good fish. This
is just our luck: we had left camp for the last few days on purpose to
get fish for food; we had caught many and salted them, and brought back
40 lbs. weight with us in a large tin can, and then, behold! we caught
fresh fish in a place where we were assured by Öla that there were none,
not even salted ones.</p>

<p>We found the camp looking uncommonly pretty and comfortable, and all
our things perfectly dry and nice. The sun shone, and blue sky appeared,
so that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page118" id = "page118">118</a></span>
hope, contentment, and joy reigned supreme, for we knew that it could
not rain any more now for at least a month, from the way it stopped
quite with a jerk as the supply ceased.</p>

<p>John spent his day at Gjendesheim in eating, drinking, and fishing,
especially the two former amusements. Truly that is a glorious country
where a man can over-eat himself three times a day, and never have
indigestion!!</p>

<h5>August 10.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Esau stalked with the usual result, ‘Ingen dyr, ingen fresk spör,
ingen gammle spör,’ as the Norsk jäger would remark; which means ‘no
deer, no fresh tracks, no old tracks;’ and he returned to camp to find
the Skipper had erected a flagstaff on the little mound beside our tent,
and from this staff now floats proudly ‘the flag that braved a thousand
years &amp;c.,’ which we brought with us for this purpose:
a&nbsp;smaller one always adorns the ridge of the tent. We do not know
exactly the use of this flag; we say it is hoisted to annoy the
Norwegians, but this reason will not bear criticism, for that is the
last thing we should think of doing, and it certainly never seems to
have that effect on any one who has yet seen it. But we think that no
gentleman’s residence is complete without a red ensign, therefore on
high days and holidays that rag will flaunt itself in the breeze; and
every day will now be a holiday, for the fine weather has begun at
last.</p>

<p>The Skipper had made all sorts of improvements
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page119" id = "page119">119</a></span>
in our domestic arrangements, and after tea we completed the alterations
in the bedroom which were necessary before John arrived. This he did in
a boat with Ivar about nine o’clock, pretty well tired with his row
against a head wind. He was received with much kindness by the barbarous
islanders, but it took us until late at night to get everything
comfortably and conveniently placed under canvas; for John made no
slight addition to our already ponderous stores, in the shape of two
more boxes containing tea, coffee, candles, sugar, jam, and at last
Esau’s long-desired anchovy paste.</p>

<p>We placed the three beds side by side in the inner tent, John being
in the middle for the sake of greater warmth, for the nights are very
cold. Among the things that we obtained through Jens were two sheepskin
rugs, invaluable for protection against cold. Till we got them we were
more or less wretched every night, but since they came our sleep has
been perfectly luxurious. John has only two ordinary Scotch rugs, and
feels the cold a good deal, so we, from our impervious sheepskins, give
him any coats, shirts, or trousers that we do not want.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Last</span> night at sunset we ‘could not
see a cloud, because no cloud was in the sky;’ the distant mountains
looked as black as coal, and the heavens were yellow-ochre colour;
whereupon Öla committed himself to the statement that the fine weather
would now be a permanent institution. Consequently our life has once
more resumed its proper phase of perpetual picnic, and we roam about
without coats or waistcoats, or any other garments that seem superfluous
unto us; and to John all garments except a landing-net and boots appear
to be unnecessary incumbrances. Reversing the natural order of things,
we put on all our available clothes when we go to bed, and peel for the
day when we get&nbsp;up.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe that only two days ago we were shivering
with cold, wrapped in gloom and india-rubber clothing, and wet through
all day, when now the horizon is dancing with heat, the lake is
perfectly calm, with the high snow mountains mirrored in its blue
depths, and we are delighting in every little bit
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page121" id = "page121">121</a></span>
of shade, having pawned our macintoshes and thrown the tickets into the
glacier torrent.</p>

<p>That same stream has been a source of great annoyance to John during
the night. He wants to have it turned off, because its roaring kept him
awake, and he was going first thing after breakfast to see the turncock
about it; but, of course, it is hopeless. The municipal arrangements
here are much the same as in London, and that official cannot be found
when
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page122" id = "page122">122</a></span>
wanted; so he will have to content himself with damming&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The hot sun has brought out flies in great profusion; the fish are
rising freely, and man goeth forth to his labour rejoicing, and cometh
home with a heavy bag and a light fly-book, for the fish here seem to be
all good-sized; and as we have to use the finest tackle and smallest
flies, the odds are rather in favour of the finny prey.</p>

<p>We all went fishing, and made a very pretty catch
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page123" id = "page123">123</a></span>
among us, the Skipper securing the greatest weight, and Esau the largest
fish, weight 3½ lbs. The Skipper also made some interesting notes on the
moral and physical characteristics of these Gjendin trout. He said there
seemed to be three methods of feeding in vogue among them. Some were
moving in a large circle about two hundred yards in diameter, and rising
at very short intervals as they went&mdash;these never came within ten
yards of the shore. Then there were some that were travelling along
about a yard from the shore, and these seemed to be rising even more
frequently than the others, as there were more flies close to the rocks
than out in mid-ocean; and there were a few cunning old beggars that had
got a comfortable hole under a rock which they did not like to leave,
and only rose at longer intervals, as especially tasty morsels
floated&nbsp;by.</p>

<p>All the fish, to whichever class of risers they might belong, often
took the moving artificial fly in preference to real dead ones that were
lying on the surface of the water close by: from which we opine that
they resemble us to the extent of liking fresh food better than stale;
for our flies had no attractive tinsel to commend them to the notice of
an epicurean trout, being the best imitations we can manage of the
predominant fly, which is a small dark-coloured winged ant, with a
little reddish orange about the long black body.</p>

<p>These flies have but a brief and disastrous existence.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page124" id = "page124">124</a></span>
They only flew for the first time this morning, most of them had died by
noon&mdash;for the lake was strewn with their corpses&mdash;and the
survivors were all worried and consumed by fish before nightfall.
Luckily there are plenty more where they came from, and the process can
be repeated on new flies tomorrow.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to catch a fish off these rocks on a perfectly
calm day like this; for in the clear water you can see the whole of the
struggle, from the moment the fish rises till he is lying panting and
exhausted in the net. How beautiful a big fish looks when he first comes
ashore! How brightly he shines in the sunlight, and how sleek is his
portly person!</p>

<p>Even if you cannot see your fish rise and take the fly, you can soon
tell by his behaviour whereabouts the needle will come if you succeed in
getting him on to the weighing hook. A&nbsp;large fish very seldom rises
with any dash or swagger, but just a smothered ripple; perhaps a glimpse
of his nose as he sucks in the fly; and he moves as if he were a nobody:
then when he feels the hook, there is none of that dash and wriggle that
you find in a small fish, but generally a rush like a rocket towards the
middle of the lake, making you tremble for the safety of your reel line,
and after that a stately diving and calm, dignified resistance for five
or ten minutes till he has to give in. Sometimes, though not so often,
the rocket business will be repeated more than once, and a fish that
does
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page125" id = "page125">125</a></span>
this deserves to escape, and often gets his <ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing">deserts.</ins> There is something very fine about
the proud bearing of a big trout in difficulties; for here in the lake
he has not the same chance as his relations in the running water at
Gjendesheim.</p>

<p>The largest fish seemed to be those feeding in a circle, and it was
one of these that Esau caught, which he said was the father of all fish.
He lost another much larger&mdash;no doubt the grandfather of all fish.
He said it weighed five pounds. It is an extraordinary piscatorial fact
that the largest fish always do get away.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Esau commenced excavating the long-promised oven
from the face of the little hill against which our tent is pitched. It
stands about a hundred yards from our hall door, and is constructed
chiefly of large stones and mud&mdash;clay not being
obtainable&mdash;with a flue cut in the hill-side: a&nbsp;single stone
acts as the floor of the oven, under which the wood furnace is kindled,
and a sod of turf, from time to time renewed, does duty as a door.</p>

<p>After this Esau finished the oven, and accomplished a bake of bread
therein, which proved so successful that on returning from fishing at
about ten at night, we all turned our attention to the production of the
staff of life, nor desisted from our labours till eleven o’clock, by
which time there was a goodly show of rolls and loaves spread out, and
we went to bed feeling that we had spent a glorious day.</p>

<p>There is not a breath the bottle-green wave to curl, and the sun

<p>The Skipper and Öla went forth to pursue, and walked over an enormous
distance into the previously unknown region of Memurutungen. Up on the
mountains life on a day of this kind is bliss; there is more air there
than in the valley, and it is delightful to be far away from the busy
world&mdash;consisting of your two pals and Ivar&mdash;below; surrounded
by the snowy peaks and sky, with not a living thing save perhaps an
eagle in sight.</p>

<p>In the middle of the day they came on fresh deer tracks, at which of
course their flagging interest revived; and presently they descried on a
snow fjeld about a mile away, two deer ‘scooting’ over the opposite
mountain side. These they followed, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page128" id = "page128">128</a></span>
made a long détour to get the right side of the breath of wind that
occasionally made itself felt up there, for the reindeer has probably
the most acute scent of all the deer tribe. In the midst of this détour
they suddenly came in sight of two other bucks, about 300 yards away,
much finer animals than the first two; in fact, they had the best heads
the Skipper ever saw. But luck was against him; they were wrong for the
wind, and a puff came just at the moment, which carried the unwelcome
intelligence to those deer that their hated enemy was upon them, and
they departed round a corner at a rapid trot, and were no more seen.
Then Öla looked at the Skipper with a sorrowful shake of the head, and
said, ‘Meget store bocks!’ (very big bucks), and the Skipper replied
with a still more portentous shake, ‘Meget, meget.’ So they were left
with their mouths wide open, muttering,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page129" id = "page129">129</a></span>
‘Meget, meget store bocks.’ And after following the tracks some time
without seeing anything more of the deer, they gave up the chase and
returned to camp, getting home in a very exhausted state about 6.30.</p>

<p>During dinner old Peter Tronhūus arrived in camp with a packet of
letters and papers, and a fore-quarter of venison from Rus Vand. Mr.
Thomas had been like ourselves reindeer-less until yesterday, when he
found a large herd, and was lucky enough to get two out of them.</p>

<p>Peter also told us that two friends of Thomas’s who had been staying
with him were walking over the mountain to see our camp, and would then
go to Gjendesheim with him in the boat in which he had come.</p>

<p>Presently these two men arrived extremely hot, and looking as if they
would like beer; so we appeased them with one of our few remaining
bottles, and after showing them all the sights of the camp took them out
on the lake in the canoes. One of them spoke a little English, the other
only French and Norwegian. The latter asked the Skipper, in the Gallic
tongue, ‘if we had entrapped many fish?’ and ‘if we had not fear to
venture on the lake in such small boats?’ and informed him that ‘there
were many savage ducks about this year.’ The other one, regardless of
his own life and safety, and also of Esau’s&mdash;in whose canoe he was
sitting&mdash;<i>would</i> keep throwing up his arms and exclaiming, ‘It
gives us
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page130" id = "page130">130</a></span>
moch playsure to make a travel in the Canadian căno.’ But we think they
were proud and thankful when the experiment was over, and they were safe
in Peter’s boat. These strangers displayed unwonted courage, for the
ordinary native has a wholesome dread of our frail craft. The hardy
Norseman’s house of yore was doubtless on the foaming wave, but that was
before the days of Canadian canoes.</p>

<p>At dinner John informed the company that his bath in the lake
yesterday was the third of a series the first of which took place in
Montenegro, the second in Algiers, and now this in Norway. He calls this
a humble tribute to the geniality of the English summer, and thinks that
he may be termed ‘a&nbsp;polyglot ablutionist.’ Some of the sojourners
in this camp say it may be so, but it does not speak highly for John’s
love of water when undiluted with whisky.</p>

<p>Subsequently we found that the bath which he swaggered about only
occurred because he fell off a rock into the lake, and so dabbled about
afterwards while his clothes were drying, which does not take long in
this weather. This also accounts for the condition in which he returned
to camp, ‘sans bags, sans shirt, sans everything,’&mdash;barring his
boots.</p>

<p>Late at night Esau, who was up last, put his head into the tent to
remark that there was a first-rate comet on view, but he was received
with such execrations from the other two lazy people in bed that he
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page131" id = "page131">131</a></span>
thought it prudent to say no more about it, and not to look at it any
more himself.</p>

<h5>August 13.&mdash;</h5>

<p>We spent the morning making a meat safe. This meat safe consists of a
hole in <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘he’">the</ins>
ground, neatly flagged with flat stones, and walled with the same, and
furnished at the top with a wooden frame, into which fits a lid with
hooks underneath it for birds. The whole is covered with a piece of
muslin to keep off the villanous bluebottles. The muslin was brought to
make into mosquito nets inside the tent, but in this happy spot the
‘skeeter’ is unknown, the sand-fly very rare, and the great green-eyed
Möge&mdash;which bites a lump out of your leg and then flies to the
nearest tree to eat it&mdash;is conspicuous by its absence.</p>

<p>We have always been very careful not to prepare in any way for game
before it is killed, but this usually successful plan has been a failure
this year, so now we are desperate, and have made a safe which will hold
a reindeer, and probably with a little more bad luck shall even go out
stalking with ropes in our pockets ready to tie up the animal when
killed. We caught Öla a week ago carving a piece of stick into the
double-ended thing that butchers put between the legs of sheep to keep
them apart (name unknown), but we promptly seized it, and made it into
the handle of a frying-pan. But who can escape his destiny? We hoped
that we had averted misfortune, but the deed was done, and no doubt it
was owing to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page132" id = "page132">132</a></span>
this that the Skipper failed to get a shot at the ‘store bocks.’</p>

<p>When John and Esau had finished the safe and succeeded in catching
enough nice fish for the requirements of the camp, they were seized with
the desire of making a good bath. We have no first-rate bathing-place
near the camp, as the glacier-river has made the lake too shallow round
its mouth, and it is some distance to where the shore becomes bold and
rocky.</p>

<p>They selected a nice little stream on the hill just above the tent,
and toiled like navvies there for about four hours under a blazing sun,
excavating and paving with flat stones, making a most palatial bath in
the bed of the stream; when behold! just as it was completed, to use the
graphic language of one of the constructors, ‘May I be dodderned, and
doggoned, and dingblamed by Pike, if the blooming stream didn’t cease to
run!’ It did just supply about a pint of water before it quite stopped,
into which Esau’s watch flew as he flung on his coat with some slight,
and perhaps excusable, show of temper. A&nbsp;pint of water is not
enough for a man to bathe in, but it is quite sufficient to saturate a
watch, especially if a stone obligingly smashes the glass and makes a
hole in its face obliterating the vii. viii. and ix. at the time of its
immersion. However, he dug the mud out of the works, filled them with
Rangoon oil, and is under the impression that that watch can be made to
go again, and that a new face and glass and silver case
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page133" id = "page133">133</a></span>
will make it look all right. He is of a sanguine disposition.</p>

<p>They returned to camp saying that it would be all right as soon as
the first rain came, but they reckoned without their host; the stream
came from a little snowdrift on the mountain, and next time that Esau
went up there he found that the heat of the last few days had melted it
all away; hence its sudden stop. It never ran again. Perchance some
future traveller will find the bath ages hence, and rejoice in its
luxurious arrangements. In anticipation of this John wrote the following
beautiful lines on the most prominent rock:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>‘Stranger, pause and shed a tear:</p>
<p>There used to be a streamlet here;</p>
<p>But seeing Esau strip to lave</p>
<p>His sordid body ’neath its wave,</p>
<p>All filled with shame and blushing red,</p>
<p>The streamlet left its gravel bed;</p>
<p>Its only wish from him to flee,</p>
<p>It ran away and went to sea.’</p>
</div>

<p>The Skipper returned rather late with some very good fish from our
old lake Rus Vand, and dinner was consequently at the extremely
fashionable hour of 8.30.</p>

<div class = "menu">

<img src = "images/pic134.png" width = "530" height = "413"
alt = "Hot Soup and Northern Lights"></p>

<p>About nine o’clock a splendid display of northern lights was produced
for our benefit, and we stayed up till twelve o’clock baking bread and
gazing at the ever-changing beauties of this glorious sight. In the
course of conversation it transpired that the same thing happened last
night in a milder form, and it was this that Esau had announced as a
comet. To-night he was immensely delighted with the show, because he
says it will bring good luck; quoting ‘Aurora bright, dear harbinger of
dawn.’ He said this
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page135" id = "page135">135</a></span>
was Shakespeare, and if Shakespeare called Aurora a ‘deer harbinger,’
that ought to be enough for us. The other two agreed, but did not
believe Shakespeare ever wrote that, or anything like it. ‘What play was
it in?’ ‘Play!’ said Esau, with the utmost contempt, ‘you awful duffers,
it’s in the sonnets; I&nbsp;dare say you never read all of them.’ This
was unanswerable, for of course no one ever did read all the sonnets.
But in revenge John composed some poetry about Esau, after the manner of
Walt Whitman, he said.</p>

<p>If Walt Whitman ever wrote anything like this, he ought to be made to
read it. We give a few lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>‘’Twas he who culled the bluest berry sweet,</p>
<p>And with his jodelling made the heights reply</p>
<p>To airs that oft have graced the music hall:</p>
<p>Anon when work or sport was put aside,</p>
<p>The fragrant omelette he would deftly roll;</p>
<p>No better man to fry the curling trout,</p>
<p>None with more appetite to make it scarce.</p>
<p>When tired nature seeks repose in bed,</p>
<p>To lie when others rise and calmly rest,</p>
<p>He most surpassed the seven Sleepers’ selves.</p>
<p>This is the sort of rubbish men can write</p>
<p>Who to inanity devote their minds;</p>
<p>But nought save great experience will suffice</p>
<p>To do the trick; no amateur can hope</p>
<p>To vie with those who’ve studied it from youth.’</p>
</div>

<p>And so on for pages.</p>

<p>On examining the diaries which we all keep, the following remarks on
the aurora were found:&mdash;</p>


<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page136" id = "page136">136</a></span>

<p class = "center smallcaps">No. 1.&mdash;By the Skipper.</p>

<p>‘The heavens were illuminated by most brilliant northern lights,
which flickered in a great arch over the starry sky.’</p>

<p class = "center smallcaps">No. 2.&mdash;By Esau.</p>

<p>‘A most glorious display of northern lights, huge bands of light
across the sky; waving, flickering, and disappearing, then suddenly
shining out again more brilliantly than before, while all the time
straight streamers of light were shooting upwards from the horizon.’</p>

<p>‘The glow of a remarkably fine aurora borealis, whose silvery
shimmering shafts flickered incessantly all over the heavens in the most

<p>It will be observed that we all agree in the flickering, consequently
you may bet it <i>did</i> flicker. But for this fortunate fact it would
be hard to recognise the three descriptions as identical, and yet this
is the way history is written.</p>

<h5>August 14.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">This</span> was a most eventful day in our
quiet life, and one fraught with episode. For the first time there was a
breeze, so the Skipper went out fishing, and John to practise canoeing
in a wind, which is an art requiring considerable dexterity in these
Canadian canoes. They are beautiful sea boats, and beat the ‘Rob Roy’
hollow for any purposes where room for baggage is required. In our two,
which are only small, we have transported between 800 and 900 lbs.; but
their worst feature is decidedly exhibited in a wind, for the broad flat
bottom and absence of keel cause them to drift very fast, and make it
difficult to keep them straight. It can only be done by paddling from
amidships instead of from the stern.</p>

<p>Esau went out stalking, full of hope from the aurora and the
favourable wind.</p>

<p>The Skipper was lucky and caught some very good fish, and then
returning to camp constructed a most lovely wimberry tart. He had just
finished the enclosure of the same in the oven, and was proceeding
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page138" id = "page138">138</a></span>
to remove the flour and ashes and other debris from his hands, while
John reclined at his ease under an awning with our latest
‘Field’&mdash;three weeks old&mdash;when they heard a hail overhead, and
behold a swarm of visitors from Rus Vand! Mr. and Mrs. Thomas, Miss
A&mdash;&mdash;, and their friend F&mdash;&mdash;, who is the most
celebrated deerstalker in the country. He is reported to never miss a
shot, and occasionally shoots flying ryper with a rifle.</p>

<p>They tumultuously demanded lunch, and the Skipper with John had a
pretty busy time of it for about twenty minutes, and the wimberry tart
had to be left to its fate in the sultry climate of the oven. Our larder
just now is not well supplied with anything except fish; so that the
utmost exertions could only produce a meal which to people who have had
reindeer for several days must have seemed poor indeed. Fried trout,
Skoggaggany soup, tea, beer, bread, biscuits, and marmalade, was the
bill of fare, for there was no time to do anything in the ‘gibier’ line,
birds taking some time to pluck and clean. However, to our guests there
were some points of this meal decidedly worthy of attention, viz. the
beer, marmalade, and bread: they have none of these at Rus Vand, as
their attempts at bread have hitherto been failures, while ours has been
very first-rate ever since the oven was built, and was much
appreciated.</p>

<p>We have been informed that the proper thing in these days, when
writing a book, is to recommend
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page139" id = "page139">139</a></span>
some condiment or patent medicine to the notice of the confiding public.
As there is no chance of our meeting any Arab sheiks in Memurudalen, we
have to fall back on this episode of the bread, and seize the
opportunity to sing to the world the praises of ‘Yeatman’s Yeast
Powder,’ by far the best that we have tried, and invaluable on an
expedition of this kind for bread, pastry, and pancakes. Now let old
Yeatman send his hundred guineas, care of Esau, and we will see that
they are devoted to a proper use.</p>

<p>To return to our guests. We made an awning on what we call the
lawn&mdash;size six feet by fourteen feet&mdash;out of two rugs and some
birch poles, and lunched under that, as the sun was cruelly hot. There
was a good deal of the ordinary picnic about the meal, as we have only
four plates, cups, knives, &amp;c., and had to eat fish out of the
frying-pan, and drink beer out of a jam pot, and a condensed-milk tin
with the top cut off and the sharp edge turned down. But all these
drawbacks were met in the true picnic spirit, which ‘de minimis non
curat’ so long as there is something to eat. Our two last bottles of
beer were sacrificed, and it went to our hearts to have to pour away our
beloved Skoggaggany soup when the cups were wanted for tea, for our
visitors did not ‘go for’ the soup with the same alacrity that
distinguishes us. Possibly it occurred to them that the middle of a
blazing hot August day was not the most suitable
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page140" id = "page140">140</a></span>
time for highly seasoned, substantial, nearly boiling liquid to be
poured down their throats.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Thomas and Miss A&mdash;&mdash; all spoke English well,
but their friend young F&mdash;&mdash; could neither speak it nor
understand it: however, he wished to be genial and polite, and replied
‘Oh yase, tank you,’ whenever any remark was made to him. In consequence
of this amiable trait, John, who thought he could talk our language as
well as the others, supplied him with beer, whisky and water, tea, soup,
and marmalade all at the same time, to each of which articles when
offered he had replied ‘Oh yase, tank you.’ This made a sad run on our
limited supply of crockery.</p>

<p>Lunch ended, the Skipper volunteered as usual to take the party one
by one for a cruise in his canoe. This with the ordinary English lady
would be a matter of considerable risk, but all Norwegians&mdash;ladies
as well as men&mdash;are accustomed to boats, and very nearly all of
them can swim. But the trip was quite dangerous enough, for both the
ladies insisted on kneeling in the right position and paddling
themselves, and there was a good sea on, with a distant threatening
storm. While Mrs. Thomas was pursuing her adventurous career, her
husband danced on the bank after the manner of a hen with ducklings
crying, ‘Come back! come back! you go too far out!’ but we grieve to
record that she did not care a little bit, and was so delighted with the
canoe that the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page141" id = "page141">141</a></span>
Skipper had some difficulty in persuading her to return. May she live
long to paddle that canoe, for it now belongs to her.</p>

<p>About four o’clock the call came to an end, and our friends departed
over the mountain to Rus Vand, at the west end of which they expected to
meet their <ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">boat.</ins>
Before going they made us promise to go and see them next Tuesday, and
will send a boat to convey us down the lake.</p>

alt = "Esau and Ola return in Triumph"></p>

<p>Soon after six Esau came into camp in an offensively jaunty manner,
followed by Öla with the heads and skins, and what the lawyers call the
appurts, to wit, the heart, kidneys, feet, and liver of two reindeer
bucks. Then was there great rejoicing
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page142" id = "page142">142</a></span>
in that little colony, and dinner was served and disposed of with light
hearts, even the neglected wimberry tart being a complete success, for
owing to its gigantic size, its long baking in a cooling oven had not
been too much for it, and it was finished to the last crumb of paste and
spoonful of juice.</p>

<p>Our custom is, when a man returns with deer, that he shall lie on the
sheepskin of indolence if so disposed, while the other fellows prepare
dinner; and after the meal is finished and men are beginning to lean
back and fill their pipes, he is expected to relate his adventures
without interruption; after this he is never to refer to them again
unless specially requested. Now for Esau’s story.</p>

<p>‘We went on to Memurutungen and began to find fresh tracks and signs
of deer almost directly, so were on the tiptoe of expectation all the
morning. About midday Öla found two deer on a small patch of snow, five
or six miles from camp, in a very favourable place for approaching them,
with the wind as right as it could be. We made a lovely stalk; but when
after an hour’s creeping we got to the spot, we were just in time to see
them disappear, slowly feeding over the hill. We followed as fast as
possible, and soon came in sight of them again, for as the deer always
feed against the wind there is no danger of alarming them by following
on their tracks. A&nbsp;few minutes of breathless crawling like
serpents, and we were within 100 yards, nearer than I ever got to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page143" id = "page143">143</a></span>
reindeer before. One of them soon gave me a nice side shot, and when I
fired he almost fell, but recovered himself, and they both ran down the
hill towards a little glacier. I&nbsp;fired again at him and missed; and
then ran as hard as I could towards the glacier, cramming in cartridges
as I ran. They were both out of sight for a moment behind some rocks,
and then the unwounded one came into view again, and I had a nice shot
at him at about 150 yards, and was lucky enough to send a bullet just
above his heart, which killed him instantly at the edge of the
glacier.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "pic143" id = "pic143">&nbsp;</a><br>
<img src = "images/pic143.png" width = "528" height = "411"
alt = "A careful Finishing Shot"></p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">‘I</ins> ran
straight on, and following round the shoulder of the hill, saw the other
one standing about 100
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page144" id = "page144">144</a></span>
yards away, unable to go any further. I&nbsp;was in about the same state
myself, so sat down, took as careful an aim as I could, and fired a shot
which finished him. How he had ever got so far is a mystery, as the
first shot only missed his heart by about an inch. The second went in
touching the hole made by the first, and killed him at once.</p>

<p>‘We gralloched them, and built the meat up with stones to preserve it
from ravens, and the great bugbear of hunters, the “<ins class =
"norway" title = "jærv, now written jerv">jarraf</ins>,” as they call
it; filfras is its English name. I&nbsp;think it is identical with the
North American wolverine or glutton.’</p>

<p>The lecturer concluded his observations amid great applause.</p>

<p>Let it be understood that the running which is done in pursuit of
deer is a gymnastic performance of the utmost difficulty, for these
mountains are almost entirely composed of loose stones with sharp, clean
edges. These stones vary in size, but otherwise are all similar, and
have no more tendency to stick together and lie quiet than the lumps in
a basin of sugar. So that running over them means&mdash;for an extremely
active man&mdash;a pace of perhaps four miles an hour; for a deer about
six or seven. Consequently the deer always when disturbed try to get on
to snow, for there they can go a great, but unascertained
pace&mdash;apparently somewhere about eighty miles an hour.</p>

<p>We find that after all we were quite right to make
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page145" id = "page145">145</a></span>
the meat-safe before killing the deer, for we only made it to hold one,
and now we have killed two, and so are quite properly behindhand with
our arrangements, and shall be obliged to make another.</p>

<p>After dinner Esau went down to the lake and tried a few casts from
the shore. He speedily hooked a fish, which he thought the biggest ever
made, and never got a sight of it for twenty minutes. He thought this a
grand top up for a truly successful day, but on landing it, it only
weighed a pound, but was hooked in the tail, hence the struggle.</p>

<h5>Sunday, August 15.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">Still</span> the same beautiful weather. We
spent the morning fishing and bathing. Esau distinguished himself by
falling into the lake off a cliff, just as he had finished dressing
after a bath; nearly swamping his canoe, full of fish, rugs, and other
valuables. There was such a sun that he merely hung his things on the
rocks and went on fishing without them until they were dry, which took a
very short time. He always had savage tendencies, and would like to live
without clothes, but we consider this is not dignified, and will not
tend to promote discipline among our retainers. The Skipper got the best
bag, as he generally does on a calm day.</p>

<p>After lunch we packed our rods, fowling-pieces, and change of raiment
into the canoes, and started on a voyage of discovery up the lake,
intending to spend the night at Gjendebod&mdash;a hut at the western end
somewhat similar to Gjendesheim at the eastern, though not so large or
so well built, for the upper end
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page147" id = "page147">147</a></span>
of the lake does not get as many visitors as the lower.</p>

<p>The expedition commenced with a disaster, owing, no doubt, to its
being Sunday. As John and Esau in the larger canoe were crossing the
glacier stream, something caused the boat to almost swamp, but
fortunately right again with a good deal of water in it. Esau said it
was John’s clumsiness; John said it was Esau’s recklessness in crossing
at such a rapid place, and much recrimination ensued. They went to shore
and emptied the water out, and then continued the voyage, nothing being
wet except the rugs used to kneel on. Only the Skipper lingered on the
voyage to fish; the other two paddling against a heavy head wind
completed the journey of five miles in about an hour, and had dinner
cooked and ready by the time the Skipper made his appearance with a
beautiful basket of trout.</p>

<p>Our dinner was made from the shoulder of venison sent us by Mr.
Thomas. It was utterly ruined in the cooking, for we are getting
fastidious after our own luxurious meals, and think as poorly of
Gjendebod cookery as a certain friend of ours did of English, when he
complained that ‘in all the houses of the rich and great which he had
ever known, he had never seen a decent hot dinner served except when
they had it cold for lunch.’</p>

<p>We found here a young Norwegian who spoke English well, and gave us
some very interesting information,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page148" id = "page148">148</a></span>
chiefly about the winter life in Norway; also a very intelligible
account of the land system of the country, which we intend to send to
Mr. Gladstone for use in his next Irish Land Bill. We think it
peculiarly adapted for Ireland, because, though we all understood it
perfectly at the time, we cannot agree about any of its main features on
comparing notes afterwards.</p>

<p>Presently there arrived here Coutts&mdash;our Gjendesheim
acquaintance who had made the extraordinary walk over the mountains. His
hair had either not grown since we last saw him, or else he had
sand-papered it off again. He had just achieved another remarkable feat.
This was a climb to the top of ‘Stor Skagastolstind,’ a&nbsp;mountain
which has only been ascended twice previously; first by an Englishman
who spends most of his time in doing such things, and afterwards by a
Norwegian, the last time being two years ago. Many others have tried and
failed. The ordinary traveller will find the feat of pronouncing its
name fluently in the course of conversation quite difficult enough; but
it can be done by the exercise of an iron will, and if not attempted
more than once in a day, no fatal effects need be apprehended. Once we
met a very careworn-looking man who told us he had been trying to make a
pun on the name, but we felt no pity for so foolhardy a wretch.</p>

<p>The authorized procedure for those who accomplish the ascent, is to
enclose their name and some coins in a bottle, and build a little cairn
round the bottle,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page149" id = "page149">149</a></span>
leaving their handkerchief with it, and bringing down the corresponding
articles left by the last man. Coutts showed us the handkerchief and
bottle which he found on the top, but the coins he must have spent in
drinks on his way home, or else did not like to trust us with them, as
he could not produce them. He had, of course, left his own handkerchief,
and John, who is short of these useful though not indispensable
articles, was seized with a great longing to risk his life and go to the
summit of that mountain for Coutts’s. At least, he was very keen about
it immediately after the description of the ascent and hiding of the
treasure; but since he became calmer we almost persuaded him not to go,
as he hates walking, especially uphill walking; it takes two days to
ascend the peak, one to get down again; and the whole performance is
slightly more difficult and hazardous than the ascent of the
Matterhorn.</p>

<p>It will probably be unnecessary to remark that Coutts did not for a
moment condescend to follow the path chosen by former climbers, but
having after considerable search found one at least twice as dangerous,
he chose that, as he had not time to look for a worse one.</p>

<h5>August 16.&mdash;</h5>

<p>After breakfast we found a drover, who was living in a hut here, and
impressed him to come out with us after Ryper&mdash;his function being
that of the dog. There are many of these drovers in the mountains during
the summer. They get cattle&mdash;how,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page150" id = "page150">150</a></span>
we do not know; whether they buy them, or merely drive them on
commission for the owners; then they feed them on the common lands, and
drive them to some town at the end of the summer. The huts that they
live in are wretched little places. There is one about two miles from
our camp, built of rough stones against a rock which forms two of the
sides, without any door or window, and only a hole to creep in at. No
Englishman would keep his dog in such a place, unless it were dead; but
we are told that a drover lived there for a month this year before we
came, and it is considered of sufficient importance to be marked on the
Ordnance map, otherwise we should never have seen&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Our drover, however, was rather a great man, living in a hut with a
real door and a window, and a live woman inside to cook for him and iron
his shirt&mdash;at least, we imagined she must be doing this, as he had
not got one&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>Ryper shooting began by law yesterday, but our Sabbatarian
proclivities prevented us from going forth to the chase. The true reason
is that we superstitiously believe it will rain again if we shoot on
Sunday, though no one will confess that this is the feeling by which we
are possessed.</p>

<p>We crossed the lake in the canoes&mdash;the Skipper and Esau to
shoot, John and Herr Drover to beat. There was a narrow belt of birch
trees between the lake and the willow belt in which we hoped to find
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page151" id = "page151">151</a></span>
the birds, and before we got through this, our ears were gladdened by
the sound of two shots from Esau, who had walked on to two old birds and
got them both; but, alas! disappointment was in store for us. We walked
up hill and down dale, dry ground and marshy, willow belt and birch
belt, but never saw another ryper for five hours, and then we put up one
old cock who fled away with a derisive crow before we got within sixty
yards of him. It is hopeless work hunting ryper without dogs. We found
plenty of places where they had fed or sat, or been running on wet
ground; but they hate flying unless they are compelled, and on a day of
this sort lie like stones, though we have seen them after windy weather
get up almost as wild as Yorkshire grouse. But we feel that we have done
our duty in trying to shoot ryper, and so now can go back to our fishing
and stalking with a quiet conscience.</p>

<p>And if we got no more ryper we found such a quantity of ‘möltebær,’
that there is every prospect of Esau being seriously ill for some days,
which would be a distinct gain as far as the consumption of our stores
goes. The ‘möltebær’ is a berry like a large yellow raspberry, very good
indeed to eat, with a sort of honey flavour about it. The Norwegians
think it better than the strawberry, though we hardly indorse this
opinion. It is a beautiful scarlet before it is ripe, and a dirty pale
yellow when ready to gather. It
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page152" id = "page152">152</a></span>
grows low down, and is difficult to find, as it conceals itself in low,
swampy, and rather dark places.</p>

<p>When we returned from the pursuit of the disobliging ryper, there was
a fair breeze down the lake, so we hoisted sails and were soon back at
Memurudalen.</p>

<h5>August 17.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">This</span> was the day appointed for our
visit to the Thomas’s at Rus Vand, but though we told Öla as usual to
call us at 7.30, he never came until about half-past eight. His watch is
a curiosity among bad watches; he sets it by one of ours every night,
and it has always gained or lost several hours before morning: on one
occasion it actually lost nearly a fortnight while we slept. The Skipper
says it ‘ain’t worth a smothered oath;’ and this morning, as we
specially wished to get up early&mdash;and did get up, owing to Öla’s
watch, more than usually late&mdash;he is getting lower in his
valuation, and estimates it at a ‘whispered d&mdash;&mdash;.’</p>

<p>We have begged Öla to pawn it, or refrain from winding it up, but
without effect, and Esau lent him his&mdash;which has never moved since
its bath, and is fixed at 5.20. This was very successful for two days,
as it made Öla call us about six o’clock, and we had lots of time to go
to sleep again afterwards; but after that the discontented fellow came
and asked for one
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page154" id = "page154">154</a></span>
that would go faster, and of course we have nothing that will compare
with his own either at trotting or cantering.</p>

<p>First thing this morning the Skipper was seen shaving his meagre chin
with no little care, and reflecting himself with considerable interest
in a slip of looking-glass that he keeps under his pillow. We all made
elaborate toilets, but the Skipper was especially beautiful by reason of
his necktie, and the least thread-bare of his two coats, which he wore
with what he considered a careless grace.</p>

<p>We started up the mountain at half-past ten, and arrived on the
shores of Rus Vand very hot and tired in about two hours. There we saw a
dim speck on the distant horizon which we imagined to be the boat coming
to take us down the lake. So we began to fish till it should arrive; and
it was a considerable time before we realised the fact that the speck we
had seen was indeed the boat, but it was <i>going</i>, not coming, for
the soulless wretch who had control of it had presumed to think, and his
thoughts being of course the mere unreasoning impulses of a brutish and
degraded mind, had caused him to suppose we were not coming. This was a
terrible blow, but at last we bravely decided to walk on to the
hut&mdash;about eight miles. During the next six pages of this book we
walked and walked and walked, with hunger and thirst raging inside us,
a&nbsp;broiling sun over our heads, and the most frightful language
proceeding from our
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page155" id = "page155">155</a></span>
lips; tramping along cattle tracks, wading through mountain torrents,
and stumbling over willows and rocks, till about half-past three in the
afternoon, when turning the last corner we came on the two huts, and our
olfactory nerves were greeted by the welcome scent of adjacent cooking
food.</p>

<p>Thomas was most profuse in his maledictions of the idiot who had left
the west end of the lake without waiting for us, and we had great
difficulty in persuading him not to shed his blood there and then. Thus
far the misery.</p>

<p>But now a change came o’er the scene. Behold the wearied travellers
lying on the sward, in the cool shadow cast by the hut; surrounded by
iced whisky punch, brandy and water, rum and milk, and claret, and
drinking them all at once under the entreaties of our hospitable
entertainers. Anon a sumptuous feast was spread under the canopy of a
tent pitched just above the roaring waters of the Russen River where it
leaves the calm of the lake for the turmoil and trouble of a hurried
descent to busier regions. That trout, reindeer, roast ryper, and the
various smaller birds will be remembered by all of us as long as we
live.</p>

<p>The Skipper confessed afterwards that all along that burning
shadeless cattle track&mdash;with its atmosphere perfectly blue with
execrations&mdash;he had thought that life was but a ‘wale of tears’ at
the best of times; but when after dinner cigars and black coffee were
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page156" id = "page156">156</a></span>
produced, he began to believe we had had rather a pleasant walk after
all.</p>

<p>We left the hospitable hut about six, in the boat, Thomas himself and
Jens coming with us. Jens rowed, and we four fished all the way up the
lake, so that the water was stiff with minnows and flies. John with a
minnow caught one three-pound trout and some smaller ones, and the
Skipper and Esau several good fish with the fly, but we had no time to
really try to catch fish, but kept rowing steadily on and getting what
we could on the way. Thomas got out halfway up the lake to fish from the
bank, and John at once trampled on a spare rod which had been brought in
the boat, and reduced it to matchwood. Then to witness John’s polite
protestations and apologies from the boat to Mr. Thomas on shore was
truly gratifying to us as spectators. When they were concluded we rowed
on to the end of the lake, climbed over the dreadful
mountain&mdash;which was by no means a pleasant task in the
dark&mdash;and reached camp at half-past ten&mdash;just twelve hours
employed in making a formal call. Think of that, ye gentlemen of England
who grumble at having to leave a card on the people the other side of
the square.</p>

<h5>August 18.&mdash;</h5>

<p>We all stayed at home to-day, as the weather&mdash;although still
perfectly fine&mdash;was not favourable for any sort of sport with which
we are acquainted except kite-flying; and the tent was constantly in
such imminent danger of being blown from its moorings,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page157" id = "page157">157</a></span>
that we feared if we went away, we should not be able to find it when we
came back. It was great fun during breakfast to watch Ivar sailing after
our goods and chattels whenever a sudden gust of wind sent them scudding
over the ground till brought to a standstill by a juniper or a rock.
Before starting in pursuit he always opened his mouth to its utmost
width&mdash;which is enormous&mdash;and then extending his arms and legs
till he looked like a demoniac wind-mill, he swooped down on the quarry,
never failing to secure the fly-away article, dish-cloth, or towel, or
whatever it might&nbsp;be.</p>

<p>The Skipper was the only one who attempted fishing, and he had but
poor sport, and soon returned to camp to assist in the operations there
going <ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">on.</ins> The most
important of these was the construction of a new game cellar in the
ground near the old one. Esau was ‘bossing’ this thing, while Öla
worked. Esau, being very lazy himself, takes a fiendish delight in
getting any work out of Öla; and now his portion of the job seemed to be
standing with an axe in his hand revolving things in his great mind
while Öla undertook the <ins class = "correction" title =
". missing">labour.</ins> The Skipper and John devoted themselves to
baking, and produced an enormous quantity of bread and biscuits; and
when these were finished the united strength of the company engaged
itself on a meat pie.</p>

<p>The division of labour in this enterprise is always managed thus.
Esau is butcher&mdash;an employment in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page158" id = "page158">158</a></span>
which he revels, and at which he is decidedly an adept. He cuts up
reindeer in convenient slices for placing in the pie-dish; adding
thereto slices of bacon, and two or three hard-boiled eggs, with some
liver, heart, and birds if we have any to spare. Meanwhile the Skipper
concocts the dough for the crust from flour, butter, and boiling water;
and after rolling the same on the top of one of the boxes with an empty
beer-bottle, neatly lines the smaller of the two low tins with it; fills
it with the various ingredients and plenty of pepper, salt, and some
water, and then covers it with a thin disc of paste perforated with
holes, and adorned with fantastic images of reindeer and birds. Now the
pie is ready for the oven&mdash;which all this time John has been
stoking indefatigably with arm loads of wood; and when he announces that
the oven is fit the pie is borne in solemn procession to it, and safely
enclosed by the sod which acts as the oven door, and conceals it from
our gaze for a time, which varies according to the size of the pie and
heat of the oven.</p>

<p>We have some difficulties to contend with in the top of our oven, for
the sods which fill in the holes thereof are liable to crumble with the
intense heat and fall down in fine dust on our food gently stewing in
its cosy nest. The only way to obviate this is to water the top of the
oven every morning as if it were a spring garden, and then the clods
never get dry enough to play their evil little games. The Skipper
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page159" id = "page159">159</a></span>
compares the baking of a pie to burial by cremation (if that is not a
bull). Certainly it always comes out etherealised; a&nbsp;thing of
beauty and a joy for at least two days. Esau called this pie after its
resurrection ‘a&nbsp;harmony in yellow and brown quite too too utter and
distinctly precious;’ and John added, ‘Begorra, me jewel, it is that
same, bedad.’</p>

alt = "The Colony at Breakfast in Memurudalen"></p>

<p>We shall now be free to do what seems good in our eyes for several
days without the trouble of baking: altogether our stock of provisions
is enormous. This is always the way in camp life; first a week of
existence on the verge of starvation, and then a time of milk and honey
and tables overflowing with plenty.</p>

<h5>August 19.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Some of the bread that John makes is rather heavy. Yesterday we were
constrained to point this fact out to him. He pretended not to be able
to see it, and in support of his theory ate at supper a quantity of the
rolls that we had condemned. The consequence was that about two o’clock
<span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span> we were roused from our peaceful
slumbers by John jumping spasmodically out of bed and rushing to the
tent door, uttering at the same time most ghastly yells. At the door he
appeared to be awake, so we said, sitting up in bed with our hair on
end,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<i>Now</i> then, John. What’s the row?’ To which he answered very
quietly,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Why, my line’s caught on that rock over there. I wish you would stop
the boat a minute.’</p>

<p>Then he went gently to bed again and continued his unbroken
slumbers.</p>

<p>A sleeping man is selfishly regardless of the disquiet he brings on
his fellow-creatures, and John, although he must have dreamt all sorts
of funny things, did not dream that he was disturbing our night’s
rest.</p>

<p>The other night when we were returning from our visit to Rus Vand,
John casually seated himself on a rock at the extreme top of the
mountain. It was quite dark except for a subdued glow of light caused by
the setting moon behind the mountains on the other side of Gjendin Lake.
Now the Skipper and Esau take a good deal of interest in moons, because
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page161" id = "page161">161</a></span>
they are considerably affected by the pallid luminary when at the full;
consequently they were aware that she had already passed her highest
point for that night, and would not show above the peaks until the
following evening; but John did not know this, and so when we asked his
reason for sitting down on a very sharp and cold stone 5,000 feet above
sea level, with the quicksilver right through the bottom of the
thermometer, at a time when all honest folk were in bed, he
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘You fellows go on; I’m going to wait here and see the moon
rise.’</p>

<p>We never disturb a man when he feels poetical, lest it should break
out in some more dangerous form; so we left him on his ‘cold grey
stone,’ and made the best of our way to camp.</p>

<p>When we had about half finished our soup, he came struggling and
wading in through the shrubs and swamp, and sat down to supper without
making any remarks about the scenery, neither did he touch upon the
subject of silver shafts, or shimmering sheen, or a network of frosted
filigree chaining down the ripples. He was evidently disappointed about
something, and we possessed too much delicacy of feeling to ask what was
wrong, and so the matter dropped. But at breakfast this morning the
Skipper happened to tell a story about a man he knew, who waited on the
quay for some friends who had arrived in a steamer that day. This man
had ordered a sumptuous
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page162" id = "page162">162</a></span>
banquet directly the steamer was signalled, then waited three hours
expecting a boat to come off every minute, but at last perceived that a
curious flag was flying on the steamer, and on inquiry found that she
was quarantined for a fortnight. Then Esau could not resist the
opportunity, and remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Just like waiting for the moon to rise when she ain’t due over the
mountains for twenty-four hours,’ and the harmony of the meeting at once
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The Skipper went after deer, but only had a very long walk without
seeing any. We have now got the kitchen into a great state of
perfection, so that within ten minutes of his return a recherché repast
was on the table. This is rather a difficult thing to manage, as we
never know to within a couple of hours what time the hunters will
return; but it can be done by having the chops, steaks, or birds ready
in one frying-pan, the trout in the other, the potatoes partially
cooked, and the tea or coffee made: the leaves or grounds of the latter
we remove always after eight minutes’ brewing, so that it does not alter
by standing. The table of course is ready laid.</p>

<p>Once and only once there was a long delay, owing to a misfortune with
the water that had been boiled for the tea; but the explosion of wrath
from the famishing hunter on that occasion was so dreadful, that the
utmost endeavours have since been successfully used to prevent its
recurrence.</p>

<p>Our procedure with pancakes is for every man to fry and toss his own;
the frying of the first side is easy enough, but the tossing requires
skill, for we do not allow the mean practice of helping the delicacy
over with a knife, indulged in by some weak-spirited cooks.</p>

<p>John’s first became a mangled heap of batter under his repeated
efforts, and was finally eaten by him in that condition; his second
ascended towards the heavens most gracefully when he tossed, and was
absent for some minutes, but unfortunately he failed to hold the pan in
the right place on its return, and it fell on the ground, where it was
immediately seized and devoured by Ivar. The third was a complete
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page164" id = "page164">164</a></span>
success, and so were the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh; the eighth
stuck to the pan, and was a failure; and after that he got along all
right to the thirty-fourth, when he had another partial failure, owing
to over-confidence. This made him more careful, and all the rest were
quite perfect. When we had finished we gave the rest of the batter to
the men, who fried it all in one huge pancake, about two inches
thick.</p>

<p>We notice that all the diaries agree for once; the following note
occurs in all:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Pancakes for dinner to-day; the other two fellows over-ate
themselves.’</p>

<p>We told John this morning of his adventure with the boat and fishing
line during the night, so he ate all the new bread at lunch, thereby
laying its restless spirit long before bedtime; no doubt he and his
dinner will slumber more peacefully to-night.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that we brought a lot of fish slightly salted
with us from Gjendesheim. Ever since our return here we have caught
plenty of fish every day, and as we prefer fresh food to salt, the
Gjendesheim fish which were placed in a little barrel have been
neglected. Five or six days ago we noticed an unpleasant odour, and
found that it proceeded from this barrel, the fish being in an advanced
stage of decomposition, and the men told us they were making ‘raki
fiske,’ a&nbsp;thing which they informed us in Norwegian is ‘real jam.’
We were very angry, and gave orders that the whole thing
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page165" id = "page165">165</a></span>
should at once be thrown into the glacier torrent. After this the affair
faded from our minds, but yesterday we again noticed a suspicion of the
same smell, and this morning it was so powerful that we began to invent
theories to account for&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>John, who is a man of great scientific attainments proved to his own
complete satisfaction, that it proceeded from the bodies of prehistoric
reindeer which had been engulfed by an avalanche ages ago and entombed
in the glacier until now, when at last their decaying corpses were being
washed down the stream.</p>

<p>He said Huxley had often observed the same thing and told him
about&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Esau’s theory was that the glacier itself was decomposing. ‘Look what
a long time it had been standing exposed to the air, and most likely in
a damp place; everybody knew that snow water was not good to drink,
witness the goître of Switzerland; and why was it not good? Simply
because it was putrid, and now that the hot sun was shining upon it, no
wonder it smelt a little.’</p>

<p>He concluded his remarks by inquiring who Huxley might be, and was
just setting off up the valley with a bottle of Condy’s fluid to pour
over the glacier, when the Skipper, who had wandered down to the Memurua
River instead of arguing, suddenly rushed back with his fingers tightly
holding his nose, and shaking his fist at Öla, said something
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page166" id = "page166">166</a></span>
that began with ‘Dab,’ and went on with other unknown words.</p>

<p>At last we gathered from his expressions that the barrel of ‘raki
fiske’ had not been thrown into the torrent at all, but our villanous
retainers had secreted it near the stream, intending to have a feast as
soon as it should have become rotten enough to please their cultivated
taste. Truly a Norwegian has the nastiest notions of food. Now the ‘raki
fiske,’ barrel and all, is buried a yard deep, a&nbsp;long way from
here, and life is again pleasant, but we have little doubt that Öla and
Ivar will come back and root about and dig it up after we have left the
country say a month hence: it ought to be in perfect condition by that
time.</p>

and hot as it is at present.</p>

<p>We three walked over the mountain to spend the day at Rus Vand,
taking our lunch with us. We got there about half-past ten, and the fish
were then rising well, so we separated and commenced fishing, the
Skipper and John taking the north side of the <ins class = "correction"

the rise stopped, as it always does on these lakes about midday.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that on a Norwegian lake the fisherman should above
all things ‘make haste while the fish rise.’ It is all very well for the
ancient sportsman to remark, ‘Take your time, my young friend, there are
as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it.’ It is no doubt true
enough; but at this time of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page168" id = "page168">168</a></span>
year they will not rise to fly for more than about a couple of hours
twice a day, and if you do not make the best of your opportunities then,
where are you? Put yourself in the place of the fine old veteran
three-pounder who has got into the habit of taking his meals at regular
hours for fear of spoiling his digestion, and has selected the hours
between 10 and 12 <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span> and 4.30 and
6.30 <span class = "smallroman">P.M.</span>, because he knows from long
experience that these are the most likely times to find flies on the
water. He has come in from roaming in deep waters to the shades of the
rocky coast, and has a certain appetite to allay after his bath and
morning stroll. There he waits, and thinks of old times, and of how fat
and shiny his tummy became the last hot summer there was, when flies
were plentiful, and he had not to resort to this
<span class = "pagenum">

abominable device of catching small trout and eating mice<a class =
"star" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">*</a> to keep him in
daily food, as he nearly always has to do now that the summers are so
wet, and he is no longer active enough to compete with his younger
relations in the struggle for existence. ‘What times those were, and how
he wishes he were a year or two younger again, and not crippled with
useless length; and, by George! now he comes to look at his reflection
against that stone, he’s getting quite yellow and bilious under the
belly, and&mdash;&mdash;’ But he can’t stop to moralise, there is a
luscious March Brown of unusual solidity skating right over his pet
rock, and he can’t let it pass. So up he comes and gulps it down, with a
lazy flop of his tail that leaves quite a swirl on the lake surface.
‘Why, the thing’s got no flavour, and how I’ve hurt my jaw with it!’
Poor old chap, his day is over, and after ten minutes’ struggle he has
left his favourite haunt to be occupied by another tenant, and is safe
in the landing net, a&nbsp;good three-pound fish, but, like most of
those who have reached this size, not quite in as good condition as he
was at 2½ lbs., and just a shade longer than he ought to be. Don’t stop
to gaze at him, put him in the bag with all speed&mdash;it is necessary

but Esau, who took the ugly side, had much the best of it to-day, as the
place seemed alive with fish, and he kept catching them all
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page171" id = "page171">171</a></span>
the time, so that his little ten-foot rod was continually to be seen in
the form of a hoop, from which position it reassumed the perpendicular
in a way that reflects no little credit on Mr. Farlow.</p>

<p>When we met again at the end of the lake on our way home, we found
that we had twenty fish, weighing just 44 lbs., of which Esau had caught
fifteen weighing 32½ lbs., the Skipper four of 9 lbs. weight, and John,
who was very unlucky, only a single two-and-a-half-pounder. The smallest
of the bag was a little over a pound, the largest three pounds, which
was reached by more than one; and nearly all were caught in water so
shallow that the dorsal fin of the fish was often visible in his mad
rushes hither and thither; this made it extremely difficult to prevent
the tail-fly being hung up on a rock whenever the fish was hooked on the
dropper, and not a few were lost in this manner. All were caught on two
patterns of fly, namely&mdash;&mdash;No, philanthropy has limits, and no
man can expect to be told patterns of flies. Go to Norway, and the time
and trouble spent in acquiring that knowledge will be amply repaid by
the pleasure that no one could fail to derive from a visit.</p>

<p>No doubt, with the usual discontentedness of man we shall regret for
ever that we did not all go to the ugly side of the lake, of which Esau
was obliged to leave the best piece untouched as he came back, from
sheer inability to carry any more fish over the rough ground. But the
ways of fish are inscrutable; we
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page172" id = "page172">172</a></span>
hardly ever caught any number on that side before, and probably shall
not do so again. It was just Esau’s day. Kismet.</p>

<p>After weighing our catch, we cleaned them and cut off their heads to
lighten them for the journey over Glopit, and even without this extra
weight we were a good deal troubled and felt overburdened on the uphill
side, which is terribly steep and rough, only just practicable for a man
on foot.</p>

<p>When we got back to camp we found that Öla had not returned from
Gjendesheim, which caused us some sorrow, as Esau wanted to go out
stalking on the morrow, and could not go alone. At least, he would be
extremely unlikely to see any deer, for the reindeer being exactly the
same colour as the mountains among which they live, it is almost
impossible to see them before they see the enemy and depart hastily.</p>

<p>These native hunters are wonderful at the profession, and seem to
know by instinct when they are in the vicinity of deer, as if they could
feel their presence in the air. No doubt they really see indications
that we should never observe, for they always begin to go cautiously,
crouching and peering over rocks when deer are about, long before we
amateurs are aware from the ordinary signs of footprints, nibbled
reindeer flowers, or newly moved stones, that there is likely to be any
sport.</p>

ON THE TOP OF GLOPIT. RETURNING FROM RUS LAKE.</p>
<!-- png 196 -->

<h5>August 21.&mdash;</h5>

<p>It was cold and windy last night, so we turned into bed early and lay
in luxurious comfort
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page173" id = "page173">173</a></span>
while John read out choice bits, all of which we know by heart, from the
works of Mark Twain. We all think Mark Twain the best writer for camp
life that has yet been discovered, and we have three or four of his
books here. Besides these our library of light literature consists of
Shakespeare, Longfellow, Dr. Johnson’s Table-talk, and novels by Whyte
Melville, Walford, and Thackeray. But Mark and William get more work
than all the rest.</p>

<p>It is quite dark now during the night, and we have made a wooden
chandelier out of a curiously bent piece of birch wood, which holds two
candles and hangs down from the ridge pole by a string. In the daytime
it is hoisted up to the roof, but at night we let it down till it swings
about two feet above our heads as we lie in bed. This contrivance is
capital for reading, and also affords considerable diversion to the last
man into bed. The candles are just too high to be reached with a puff
easily from a recumbent position, and yet we persistently try to blow
them out without moving. Just as sleep is creeping over two of the
wearied sportsmen, the last man begins blowing and cussing at these
candles every night regularly. The scene is generally this. Skipper and
John just dropping off to sleep. Esau lies down, makes himself extremely
comfortable, and then&mdash;puff, whoo, whew, puff,&mdash;gasp for
breath, rest a moment. Pouf. Chandelier swings round under the impulse
of the strong wind thus created. Esau makes a brilliant
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page174" id = "page174">174</a></span>
flying shot at one candle, as it circles swiftly past. Skipper: ‘Thank
goodness.’ Pause. Esau: Poof, whoo, whoof. John: ‘Dash it all, get up
and put it out.’ Esau: ‘Get up yourself.’ Skipper: ‘Let me blow it <ins
class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">out.’</ins> Pouf,
puff, whoosh. Chandelier swings madly round, drops grease on John’s
nose. John: ‘Tare an ’ouns.’ Throws tobacco pouch at it, more grease all
over the place, tobacco pouch rebounds from tent into Esau’s mouth.
Recrimination for five minutes. Chandelier at last stationary. Everybody
at once: ‘Puff, boo, pouf, whew, &mdash;&mdash; it, &mdash;&mdash; it,
pouf, &mdash;&mdash; it, &mdash;&mdash; the &mdash;&mdash; thing &mdash;
&mdash; &mdash; pouf. Thank goodness;’ and we all turn over with a sigh
of relief, to repeat the performance the following night.</p>

<p>Öla not having turned up, there could be no stalking, so the
beautiful morning was wasted. The Skipper got so angry about it that he
said he would go in his canoe to find the absentee, and take at the same
time a lot of our surplus fish for the people at Gjendesheim.</p>

<p>Leaving the tent on its grassy sunlit lawn he walked down to the edge
of the great lake, and turning over the smaller of the two canoes, which
were lying bottom uppermost, launched her and got in with rod and
fishing bag, and pushed off into the deep. Opposite to the place where
the canoes were drawn up, and apparently only a hundred yards distant
though really more than a mile away, were the snow-capped mountain
steeps that rise almost perpendicularly
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page175" id = "page175">175</a></span>
from two to three thousand feet out of the lake; and for these he made,
gradually becoming a mere twinkling speck till he faded out of sight
from the tent. The lake was as smooth as glass, only occasionally
rippled as some monarch of the deep, excited for once in his life by
some specially fascinating fly, condescended to make a rush for it
instead of the gentle suck by which he usually took his food, and the
Skipper paddled leisurely along within twenty yards of the rocks, with
his rod bending over the stern, and trailing behind a couple of flies in
the hope of catching a trout without the trouble of angling for him.</p>

<p>It is very pleasant to be alone once in a way in this overcrowded
world. Not alone as it is possible to be in England, but absolutely
alone, with no living thing near except the trout, the insects, and
one’s image in the water. Oh, blessed Norway! when we get back to the
turmoils, troubles, and pleasures of a London season how we shall long
for you! There is only one word to express this existence, and that is
Freedom&mdash;freedom from care, freedom from resistance, and from the
struggle for life. What a country! where civilised man can relapse as
much as seems good to him into his natural state, and retrograde a
hundred generations into his primeval condition.</p>

<p>But we forget that the Skipper is coasting up towards Gjendesheim in
search of the miscreant Öla.</p>

<p>He proceeded for a couple of hours, catching a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page176" id = "page176">176</a></span>
few fish now and then, but presently as midday approached, the sun
became too hot to be pleasant, the fish would not move, and the Skipper
began to get impatient and annoyed at not meeting Öla. After a while a
black speck with two flashing arms appeared rounding a promontory; this
was Öla in the boat. The Skipper was boiling with rage under the
influence of various incentives as he approached. Öla, like most
Norwegians, was calm, placid, and utterly unconscious of the flight of
time and the shortness of life. The Skipper had been primed to exploding
point by his two friends before starting, and as he had now paddled five
miles from home without meeting the adversary, he was, to put it mildly,
‘indignant.’ So, when he found Öla smoking serenely, and sculling along
as though his brief span were going to stretch through the unending
cycles of eternity, he gave way to the most horrible outbreak of temper
in English, which must have lasted four or five minutes, and then
telling the caitiff in Norwegian to take the fish to Gjendesheim and
return to camp by five o’clock whatever the weather might be, he turned
and left that hardy Norseman open-mouthed and bewildered, looking as
though he had seen the Strömkarl, or had had an interview with his
mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Then a great wind arose, and blew against the Skipper all the way
home, but he arrived in the most beatific frame of mind in spite of it;
the relief of the storm of temper and bad language had been so great
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page177" id = "page177">177</a></span>
to him, that he was filled with a blessed joy. He said it was the most
invigorating and refreshing pastime he ever indulged in, for Öla could
not understand a word of it, and therefore no remorse could follow the
outburst, not a thoughtless expression or hasty word could go home to
his heart and there rankle, to recoil on some future occasion, but the
whole vial of pent-up wrath could be emptied on its object without fear
of retribution.</p>

<p>The explosion must have been something very fine to enable the
Skipper to make light of the head-wind, for a wind on Gjendin is not to
be scoffed at in any boat, and least of all in a cockle-shell of a
canoe. The mountains are so high and steep that the lake lies as it were
in a trench, and any wind always draws straight up or down the length,
and soon gets a big sea up. All the Norwegians we have seen say it is
the height of madness to go on Gjendin at all in such boats, the sudden
squalls are so dangerous; and neither of our men can be persuaded to go
a yard in them.</p>

<p>Esau and John, for want of better employment, after fishing a little,
began to bake, and had laid out a goodly show of dainty confections, two
dozen rolls, four wimberry tarts, a&nbsp;lot of biscuits, and a venison
pie of the ordinary size (9&nbsp;inches diameter). When the Skipper
returned it was decided to make another, as we imagine the meat has a
better chance of keeping when hoarded up in pies than when left in its
raw state.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page178" id = "page178">178</a></span>
<p>So we each took our usual share in the construction of a PIE, before
which all other pies should be as nought.</p>

<p>It was made in our largest baking tin, 12 inches across, and
contained nearly a hind quarter of venison, our last six eggs,
a&nbsp;heart, a&nbsp;liver, and about 1½ lb. of bacon. The crust was put
on about nine o’clock, and after we had all gazed at it and unanimously
agreed that it was the ‘boss pie,’ we bore it proudly but gingerly to
the oven, heated by John seven times hotter than before, and now gaping
to receive it; a&nbsp;great full moon rose up from behind the mountains
and seemed to smile on our good work; the bright fire shed a red glow
over the three figures bending o’er the simmering treasure, and a more
peaceful, domestic group it would be impossible to conceive.</p>

<p>About eleven John and the Skipper turned in, but outside could be
seen for some time the solitary form of Esau still crouching over the
expiring embers of the oven, and tending with a mother’s care the
tempting food that he already tasted in imagination.</p>

BAKING BY NIGHT IN MEMURUDALEN.</p>
<!-- png 204 -->

<p>Most of the <a name = "berry_text" id = "berry_text">berries</a> of
the country are now just at their best, and Memurudalen is a grand
valley for all of them, except of course the strawberry and raspberry,
which will not grow at this altitude. But we have ‘klarkling’ (the
English crowberry) in great abundance; blau bær (wimberry), the finest
and best ever seen, in quantities; also ‘skin tukt,’ another blue
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page179" id = "page179">179</a></span>
berry rather larger than a wimberry, and with a thicker skin and
wonderful bloom on it; this we think does not grow in England. Then less
numerous are a berry something between a raspberry and a red currant,
but of better flavour than either of them; and the great and glorious
‘mölte bær’ (cloudberry); to say nothing of ‘heste bær,’ and ‘tutti
bær,’ and several others of unknown names. The last one grows in
England, but we have forgotten its name; they make jelly from it here,
and prize it highly for its acid taste.</p>

<h5>Sunday, August 22.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">We</span> woke up this morning with a
bright sun shining through the canvas of the tent, and making it
intolerably hot inside; and as we threw open the door of the inner
compartment, the fragrant aroma of the ‘boss pie’ was wafted to us on
the morning air.</p>

<p>We spent the morning in quiet Sunday fashion, chiefly in lying under
the shade of an awning made with rugs which we call the ‘sycamine tree,’
and eating wimberries and cream. Besides this we perpetrated a great
deal of high art; every one was seized with the desire of sketching the
camp, and so we sat around on pinnacles like so many pelicans, libelling
the unfortunate place from every position whence it could be seen.</p>

<p>It is looking very comfortable just now. The tent itself is pitched
in an angle of a steep little cliff which effectually protects it from
cold winds at one side and the back, and at the other side we have put
up a thick fence of birch branches to temper the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page181" id = "page181">181</a></span>
storm to the sleeping-tent. We find it very convenient to have the two
compartments: the inner one is only used for sleeping in, and always
immediately after reveillé is plunged in an apparently hopeless
confusion of rugs, sheepskins, mattresses, and boots, with here and
there a book or a hat protruding (to use the Skipper’s beautiful simile)
like brickbats in a dust-heap. After breakfast all the bedding is
dragged out to be aired on the rocks, and the tent generally tidied.</p>

<p>But the outer tent is always a picture of order and neatness, for
here we keep our stores, boxes of flour and biscuits, cartridges,
cooking utensils, tools, whisky, and potatoes. One of the boxes was made
specially under Esau’s directions to be used as a table: the top and
bottom are both hinged, and so when the box is put on its front and
these two lids opened it makes a very good large table; the lids are
held up by a batten screwed underneath them, and for greater security we
have added two legs. But at present the weather is so pleasant that we
always feed outside, a&nbsp;few yards from the tent and nearer to the
oven.</p>

<p>On the extreme left, as the penny showman says, you will observe one
of the meat safes, the other one ‘thou canst not see, because it’s not
in sight,’ being close to the back of the tent. Also behind the tent may
be faintly seen the mustard and cress garden, always covered with a
sheet by day to save it from
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page182" id = "page182">182</a></span>
the heat of the sun, and with the same sheet by night, to guard it from
the cold, so that the poor thing never gets any light, and does not
flourish very exceedingly. None of the mustard seeds have as yet grown
up as big as the one in the parable, but when one does we mean to make a
lot of salad out of it, enough for all the camp.</p>

<p>Above the middle of the outer tent are three things which look like
lightning conductors, but are only our rods, which are always stuck in
the ground there when not in use. At their foot under the rock is the
egg larder, neatly constructed of stones and turf, with a wooden lid;
and hanging from the cliff hard by is a very pretty and curious spider’s
nest made of paper, like a miniature wasp-nest, about two inches in
diameter.</p>

<p>High up in the centre is ‘the meteor flag of England,’ engaged in its
customary occupation of ‘yet terrific burning,’ there being absolutely
no Dutch Boers here. Underneath its shelter are many forked poles with
cross-bars, all made from the birch with which the valley abounds just
here, and on which clothing of some sort is always hanging out to dry;
so that the place looks like a laundry-ground, and deceives even the
ravens, which come down in swarms from the mountains in search of maids’
noses to devour. In the midst of these poles may be seen the oven, with
its flue reaching halfway up the hill, and its two openings, the lower
one for fuel, the upper for food.</p>

THE CAMP IN MEMURUDALEN.</p>
<!-- png 210 -->

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page183" id = "page183">183</a></span>
<p>Right in front of the tent is the fireplace, a long trench in the
ground, faced with stones of such a size and shape that they form
apertures suitable for our numerous pans; and simmering by the fire is
the perennial soup. Nearer to the front is the wood pile, and nearer
still the board on which the cooking things are placed after washing up.
In front again of this is the little stream which supplies us with
water, now rapidly beginning to fail under the influence of the long
drought: it may be noticed that the engineers have changed its course in
several places for greater convenience in getting water, and to give
more room on the camp side.</p>

<p>The foreground is a mass of juniper, wimberries, skintukt,
crowberries, and rocks, and then comes about thirty yards from the tent
the Memurua torrent, all thick and milky from the glacier, cold as
Christmas, fishless, uninteresting, not drinkable, only useful as a
refrigerator for milk, and only agreeable to look upon from a distance,
but faithfully keeping up the unceasing roar that is customary among
such torrents. This river makes the waters of the lake too cold to bathe
in and too cheerless for fish to abide in near our camp, but it does not
come into the picture, partly because it runs in a ravine, but more
because it was right behind the artist.</p>

<p>The lake itself is to the extreme right, with unclimbable snow-capped
rocky mountains forming the opposite coast.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page184" id = "page184">184</a></span>
<p>To-day we dined at 4 <span class = "smallroman">P.M.</span> in order
to get an uninterrupted evening’s fishing, but the experiment was not a
success and will not be repeated, for it spoilt the dinner and we caught
no fish. On returning to camp at night rather cold, very cross, and
exceedingly hungry, we agreed that the best antidote for these dangerous
symptoms would be hot soup, so John put the pot on the fire while the
Skipper and Esau were attending to the tent and domestic duties.</p>

<p>Soon the caldron was heated and brought into the tent, and the eager
crowd drew near with cups and spoons, and one lifted the lid, while
another plunged his cup into the steaming savoury mess. And then arose a
great cry of horror and desolation, and the sleeping valley rang with
the wail of men in despair, for John had put the wrong pot on the fire,
and we had been presented with boiling dirty water in which the
dinner-things had been washed up; while all the time the soup pot was
quiet, untouched and cold in the corner of the tent where it is
kept.</p>

<p>But three hungry men are not to be balked of a meal on which their
hearts are set by any trifle like this, so we all commenced with a will
to stoke that fire up and put that other pot on, and we got our soup and
were snugly packed in bed long before the gentle August moon had sunk to
rest behind the sheltering mountain tops.</p>

<p>The Skipper, by the way, is very much exasperated with this same moon
just now. He says she is a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page185" id = "page185">185</a></span>
fraud, for this morning when we got up, there she was high in the
heavens.</p>

<p>‘What right,’ he wants to know, ‘has this moon&mdash;any moon, in
fact&mdash;to be up there blinking away in the middle of the day when we
have plenty of sun to light us? forward, dissipated thing! and then
probably after this week we shall have ever so many nights without any
moon at all, and all the earth left in total darkness to take care of
itself; while here we are to-day with an absurdly round moon at one end
of this comparatively diminutive valley, and a most extravagantly
blazing sun at the other.’ The whole thing is ridiculous, he says, and
it must be confessed that there is some justice in his complaint; though
no doubt there could be a good deal said on the other side.</p>

<h5>August 23.&mdash;</h5>

<p>While Esau went out after deer the other two crawled up the mountain
and over to Rus Vand to fish, and had a good day. Two of the Skipper’s
fish were three pounds each, but, like most of the biggest fish, not in
that beautiful condition which the smaller ones always show. The Skipper
is sure that the old worn-out fish creep up to the stony shallows at the
western end of the lake to die in a sunny spot, just as we men creep
away in our old age to Bath, Cheltenham, Cannes, or Algiers, to breathe
our last in a warm place, thereby taking one step in the direction of
the proverbial future.</p>

<p>Esau arrived in camp about half-past seven, quite
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page186" id = "page186">186</a></span>
exhausted, and followed by Öla, also dead beat, and again bearing the
heads and skins of two deer, a&nbsp;buck and a doe. He was hailed with
fervent joy and many congratulations: it is certainly great luck to fall
in with deer on two stalking days in succession, for they are by no
means numerous here this year. Dinner was served in a marvellously short
time.</p>

<p>Then came Esau’s romance.</p>

<p>‘We walked up the Memurua to the great glacier, and then skirted its
south side. We found many fresh tracks, and about two o’clock, when we
were seven miles from home, Öla spied three deer chewing stones about
three quarters of a mile away. The
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page187" id = "page187">187</a></span>
wind was just in the right direction to allow us to approach them, and
they were in capital ground for stalking, full of little hollows and
slopes. But there was a serious drawback: on one side was a lake, on the
other an impassable precipice; and before we could get into a place out
of their sight we should be obliged to cross a narrow strip of ground in
full view of them, though perhaps half a mile from them. We sat down and
had our lunch, and waited an hour watching for them to lie down, and at
last they did so; then we determined to risk the passage of the
dangerous strip, and by crawling like serpents and aided by luck got
across without the <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘dear’">deer</ins> seeing us. Then we had to creep along the side of a
scandalous precipice for the next half-mile, in no danger of being seen,
but with our hearts constantly in our mouths as, despite our care, some
stone was dislodged and went clattering down the rocks, sounding to my
strained ears as if it must disturb every living thing within a mile.
Very slow and difficult was our progress, occasionally dangerous, but at
last we arrived at a spot 200 yards from the deer, which were still
lying down, and pronounced by Öla to be a buck and two does.</p>

<p>‘This was a very awkward place to shoot from, and I thought I could
see my way to a better one much nearer, so tried it and found it was
just possible, and after about a quarter of an hour’s worming,
I&nbsp;arrived at a place only 100 yards from them. From
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page188" id = "page188">188</a></span>
this I could see both the does well, but only the head of the buck, and
so had to lie there an hour waiting for him to get up. Both the does did
so twice, offering beautiful shots, but he would not move, and they lay
down again. I&nbsp;dare not whistle to make him jump up, for fear the
does might possibly be in the way at the moment. So there I lay,
miserably uncomfortable, with cramp in every muscle; and at last I tried
to crawl to another stone about five yards away, from which I thought I
could see to shoot at the buck. When I got to it and peered cautiously
over, I&nbsp;was horrified to see the deer some distance away, and
running as hard as they could towards a small glacier which was close to
them.</p>

<p>‘Of course I instantly lost my head, and jumping up fired at the buck
without much aim, and missed him. Then I recovered my senses and made a
careful shot at the last doe, knocking her over like a rabbit. The other
two were just then out of sight in a hollow, but they appeared directly
going up the hill on the snow at a great speed; and getting a broadside
shot at the buck I broke his shoulder; after this he went slowly, but
still kept on up the hill, and when he was about three hundred yards
away I fired two more shots, one of which hit him in the ribs, and the
other cut one of his horns off. Then he gave up trying to mount the
hill, and turned down towards the lake out of my sight. I&nbsp;ran as
hard as I could across the shoulder of the glacier, and saw him standing
down below me among the rocks close to the water, and sitting down I
fired another shot which killed him.</p>

<p>‘This is not a creditable performance in the shooting line; but my
solid bullets have a good deal to do with the matter: either of the
first two shots would have stopped him at once if fired from an express
with hollow-pointed bullets.</p>

<p>‘The doe is a barren one with a beautiful skin, and very fat, and the
buck is the best we have killed at present this year,
a&nbsp;four-year-old, what Öla calls a “litt stor bock” (little big
buck), which I suppose is the next best thing to the mythical “meget
stor bock,” whose footprints we are always seeing, but who carefully

<a name = "page190" id = "page190">190</a></span>
absenteth himself whensoever the jovial hunter goeth forth to pursue
him.</p>

<p>‘We saw a great deal of fresh spoor to-day, so that we may hope the
deer are beginning to come to our part of the country: perhaps the poor
things have been very much bullied in other places. Anyhow, they won’t
find any better country in Norway than where we went to-day; and the
scenery there is glorious.’</p>

<p>Esau was so tired that he fell asleep once in the midst of his
exciting narrative, and as dinner was very late we all turned in almost
as soon as it was finished.</p>

<h5>August 24.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">There</span> is a brood of ryper on the
brow of the mountain above our camp, which we always put up when we walk
over Glopit armed with rods, but never when we take a gun. There were
originally eight of them, but one has succumbed to a merlin which hunts
up there; and they are remarkably tame, so that when we put them up we
throw stones at them, and fully expect to kill them by that means, but
somehow they have escaped with their lives until now. This conduct has
become unbearable, and we have sworn ‘this day that brood shall die;’ so
the first thing after breakfast Esau and the Skipper toiled up the
mountain with pockets full of cartridges and guns ready for the
slaughter of the innocents. It takes just three quarters of an hour to
get to the top; and after reaching it we tramped over some millions of
acres in search of that brood, and of course it never obtruded itself on
the scene. Finally the Skipper went home in disgust, remarking that ‘he
wished every ryper in Norway was at the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page192" id = "page192">192</a></span>
bottom of Gjendin;’ while Esau said ‘he would stay up there a month or
two and find those birds if they were anywhere on our sheet of the
Ordnance map.’</p>

<p>The Skipper had hardly walked 200 yards towards camp before he trod
on the old cock, who got up observing kek! kek! kekkekkek<i>kek</i>,
kurrack: kur<i>rack</i>; kurrack, krackrackackckkkkk! in an extremely
indignant tone of voice, and the rest of the family immediately followed
him, astonishing the Skipper so much that he missed the lot; and though
we marked them down quite near we could not persuade any of them to risk
their lives in flight again.</p>

<p>The language used on this occasion scorched the herbage off so large
a patch of ground, that John down below thought that Glopit had suddenly
commenced a volcanic eruption.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of birds known as ryper in Norway&mdash;the fjeld
or skarv ryper, which is, we think, identical with our ptarmigan; and
the dal or skog ryper, which we believe to be the same bird as the
willow grouse of North America. The former of these is not numerous
anywhere, but a few are always seen by the reindeer hunter up on the
highest parts of the mountains, among the snow and rocks. They do not
attempt much concealment, but their grey bodies and white wings are so
exactly the colour of their habitation that it is very difficult to see
them, as they sit perfectly still on the stones. If you do happen to
catch sight of one, in all probability after
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page193" id = "page193">193</a></span>
looking at him for a little you will suddenly be aware that there is a
small family of others all about him, and will wonder how they escaped
your notice at first. They are not very useful for sporting purposes, as
they are never found in great numbers, are too tame to give any trouble,
and not particularly good to eat. The skog ryper is the bird which takes
the place of the British grouse for the sportsman in Norway: he lives at
a lower altitude than the skarv ryper, among the willows, wimberries,
and stunted birches. In plumage he is not unlike our grouse, but not
quite so red in shade, and with a white wing. During the summer he feeds
on wimberry leaves, heather, and occasional bits of willow, and he is
then almost if not quite equal to a grouse in flavour, but in winter,
when there is nothing but willow to be had, the flesh becomes bitter and
not nice to eat: the poor birds are then snared in great numbers, and
may be seen hanging in English shops as ‘ptarmigan,’ which with their
then white plumage they much resemble. After a good breeding season
these skog ryper are very numerous in any favourable place in Norway,
but they are so much inclined to lie close, that without dogs it is
impossible to do much with them. Gjendin is too steep and desolate for
them, but between the east end of the lake and Sjödals Vand there is
some first-rate country, and also a little at the west end.</p>

<p>After lunch we all manned Esau’s canoe, which is the largest, because
he is the smallest man; and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page194" id = "page194">194</a></span>
set off down the lake to Leirungsö, the place where the professor’s hut
is built at the edge of the waterfall which runs out of a small lake
there (not the real Leirung’s Vand, which is further to the east).</p>

<p>The Skipper had noticed a remarkably fine bed of mölte bær there,
which we expected to be just about ripe now, and so we had determined to
picnic&nbsp;(!) there, forsooth, as if our life were not one perpetual
and perennial picnic.</p>

<p>Leirungsö is nearly four miles from our camp, and the professor’s hut
is an extremely comfortable and convenient little dwelling, in a most
charming situation. Only one thing has been wanting, reindeer: he never
found any, and left his hut a fortnight ago for a place further north,
where we afterwards heard he had good sport.</p>

<p>After landing, the Skipper and Esau climbed up the valley to the
little lake in search of something to shoot, while John remained to
bathe and fish at the fall. There were lots of duck on the little lake,
and in the rushy swamp at its upper end, and the Skipper put up a large
brood of ryper, which we marked into a very small patch of willow scrub
surrounded by bare ground. We walked through and through that patch, and
threw so many stones into it that we fancy we must have killed and
buried most of them, for we only persuaded four of them to fly again,
three of which we secured. Our shooting was soon over, and then we
gathered a lot of mölte bær,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page195" id = "page195">195</a></span>
and returned to John, who was getting dinner ready; and after a regal
repast of kidneys, reindeer pie, and mölte, paddled home by moonlight,
arriving soon after nine.</p>

<p>We beguiled the journey home by songs and accompaniments by the
following celebrated artists: Messrs. John, Skipper, and Esau. Among
other songs was an original composition by John&mdash;air, ‘Bonnie
Dundee’&mdash;</p>

‘Unbroke.’ This is bold poetic imagery, meaning unopened. Breakages were
unknown during our expedition, and long experience justifies us in
assuring the world that breaking the pot, though an effectual way of
getting at the marmalade, is not a satisfactory method. It will be found
much better to remove the bladder at the top. This may be
depended&nbsp;on.</p>

<p><a class = "tag" name = "note2s" id = "note2s" href = "#tag2s">2</a>

‘Take.’ This word is only used by poetic licence, and must not be
construed literally. When we attempted to ‘take’ John’s whisky on our
return to camp, there was a good deal of ill-feeling engendered, and he
said that no one but himself understood the subtleties of æsthetic
metaphor.</p>

‘Bug.’ Again poetic licence. ‘Cimex lectularius’ has not been
encountered during our stay in Norway this time; nevertheless he is not
unknown in the country, as the sojourners in one of the Lillehammer
hotels, not the Victoria, can testify.</p>

‘Skeeter.’ The mosquito is a mournful and disgraceful fact; and so are
the sand-fly, the stomoxys, and the flea. Memurudalen is more free from
insects than any place we have tried.</p>

<h5>August 25.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Still the same glorious weather, rather too glorious for our purling
rivulet, which has now dwindled away to a mere thread of water, while
even the larger stream on the hill behind the tent, which we use for
bathing, is showing a marked decrease in volume.</p>

<p>The Skipper and Öla went out stalking directly after breakfast, and
Esau climbed up on to Bes Hö to shoot ryper. John went over to Rus Vand
to fish, and had a pleasant day. He managed somehow to drop his native
‘tolle kniv’ into the lake, and of course immediately discovered that
that knife was the most precious thing he possessed, in fact, the only
thing he cared about in this world; though until it fell into the lake,
he had regarded it with very unenthusiastic feelings&mdash;feelings of
tolle-ration, the Skipper said. So he undressed and dived for it for a
long time, and at last was lucky enough to recover it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page198" id = "page198">198</a></span>
<p>It would have been a pleasing sight to a spectator, if any could have
been present, to watch John playing at being a seal all by himself in
Rus Vand, or standing on a rock poised on one leg like a heron, with his
head sideways and keen eye piercing the cerulean wave. And it was good
to see his proud bearing as he returned to camp with the ‘tolle kniv’
slung jauntily at his waist, and carrying over his shoulder the scaly
spoil snatched from the vasty deep, as we used beautifully to word it in
Latin verses&mdash;meaning the fish he had caught.</p>

<p>At 8 <span class = "smallroman">P.M.</span> the Skipper had not
returned, so we dined, and then sat round the fire wondering what could
have happened to delay him; and as time went on and still he never came,
we began to get very uneasy; there are so many dangers by which the
reindeer
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page199" id = "page199">199</a></span>
hunter may be overtaken&mdash;avalanches, crevasses, fogs, snowdrifts,
broken limbs, or getting lost. We could only hope that none of these had
happened to the Skipper, and at eleven o’clock gave up any hopes of his
return that night and turned in, there being then a very decided fog a
short way up the Memurua valley.</p>

<h5>August 26.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">At</span> breakfast-time the drover who had
accompanied us to shoot ryper at Gjendebod arrived here on his way
towards lower and more genial regions for the winter. We always feel
that we are killing more game than we really need, and here was an
outlet for our superfluous meat, so we gave him half a deer, and he went
homewards rejoicing greatly.</p>

<p>We had sent Ivar up to the drover’s den in Memurudalen at daybreak to
see if our missing ones had found their way to it and spent the night
there, but he now came back without having found any traces of them.
However, under the cheering influence of the morning sun we soon became
resigned to their fate, and Esau so far regained his spirits that he
crossed the glacier torrent with a gun, and penetrated the birchwood on
the other side, to what he called ‘shoot the home coverts.’ He presently
brought back a woodcock, which had got up about fourteen times before he
killed it, and each time he had thought it was a fresh cock, so that he
had had a regular sporting
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page201" id = "page201">201</a></span>
morning after it, ‘seeing lots of cock get up, shooting at two, and
killing one of them,’ the wood being so thick that it was almost
impossible to get even the snappiest of snap-shots at the agile
bird.</p>

<p>Esau then busied himself with the construction of a rack to hold all
our guns and spare rods, cleaning rod, &amp;c., with a shelf near the
bottom for books, and another one whereon each man might keep his little
valuables, such as pipes and watch, fly-books and reels. This
contrivance was chiefly formed of birch boughs of peculiar shape, and
when finished and placed in its proper position at the further end of
the tent just behind our pillows, it presented a truly noble
appearance.</p>

<p>Lunch-time passed, and still the Skipper had not returned, so we
decided that he must be defunct, and proceeded to write his epitaph,
preparatory to organising a search expedition to bring in his
remains.</p>

<p>Here is one touching little poem:</p>

<div class = "verse">

<p>While we were still lingering over these beautiful and appropriate
sentiments, and deliberating as to whether they should be cut on a stone
or only on wood, the corpse suddenly walked into the tent and announced
that he wanted something to eat. We soon got over our natural
disappointment at the waste of a good epitaph, and really welcomed him
quite warmly, much more so when Öla appeared laden with the tit-bits of
a reindeer buck. Then we set food before the Skipper, and after he had
feasted he related unto us his story.</p>

<p>‘I left camp yesterday morning determined to

beard the savage untamed reindeer of the mountains in his lair, and soon
came on very fresh tracks, which we followed for some time, and at each
step seemed to get “hotter,” as the children say, and the indications of
deer being near got more and more encouraging. However, by one o’clock
we had seen nothing, so sat down behind a little rocky eminence to have

knife back in its sheath, when we heard a slight snort quite close
to&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>‘Öla immediately peeped cautiously over an adjacent stone; then he
pushed my rifle into my hand and whispering the magic word “Reins,”
pointed to another stone a few yards away, whither he wished me to
crawl. To unsling my cartridge-bag lest it should jingle, and creep to
that stone, was what the novelists call the work of a moment: then I
raised my head <i>va-a-ry</i> gingerly, and saw forty yards away a
single four-year-old buck standing broadside to me with his head in the
air, sniffing suspiciously, and his whole attitude denoting uncertainty
and caution. This buck, as we found out afterwards from the spoor, had
walked up to within ten yards of us as we sat at lunch; then he must
have either heard me or smelt Öla, probably the latter, for Öla seldom
washes his hands, never his blood-stained hunting coat; and when I
encountered his gaze he had evidently just decided that this was not a
good place for reindeer to be about in. This was an excellent frame of
mind on his part, but he arrived at it a couple of seconds too late: my
rifle was levelled, and the shot hit him just above the heart. At that
distance the express bullet smashed a portion of him about as big as a
hat, so that he rolled over stone dead, and had no time for lingering
glances or last words. Half an hour more, and he was skinned,
gralloched, put in a hole and buried under a heap of stones, to remain
there
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page205" id = "page205">205</a></span>
until we need his flesh and send the horse to bring him home. Then we
built a little cairn to mark his resting-place for future use, and
wandered on in search of the rest of his party.</p>

<p>‘Very soon we came on the tracks of four other deer, one of them only
a calf, but although we followed the spoor all the afternoon we never
came up with them: probably they were near enough to hear my shot when I
fired, and at once betook themselves to remote regions.</p>

<img src = "images/pic205.png" width = "406" height = "233"
alt = "Öla performing the Funeral Rites"></p>

<p>‘It had got so late before we gave up the search, and we were such a
long way from home, that we determined to go to Gjendebod, at the
Western end of the lake, hoping to get a boat there and return to
Memurudalen by water. But on arriving there very tired, hot, and hungry,
we found that the men had taken their boat down the lake, and would not
return until to-day. This was a great blow, for it is quite impossible
to walk along the shores of Gjendin,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page206" id = "page206">206</a></span>
except, as John says, for a bird&mdash;and even it would have to fly all
the way. Climbing up the mountain again was out of the question, as it
is a seven hours’ walk from Gjendebod to our camp, so there was nothing
for it but sleeping there&mdash;a course which was very distasteful to
me, as the food is bad, and I had no book with me, no tobacco, no
hair-brush, and no fishing-rod.</p>

<p>‘To-day I started for home directly after breakfast. We wished to
combine a little stalking with the walk, for we had to pass through some
first-rate deer country&mdash;all that part, Esau, where you got your
first two bucks; but of course we had not much chance of doing anything,
as the wind was with us all the way. As you know, deer almost always
feed up wind, so by walking against it you are safe from their ears and
noses, and also are likely to be warned of their presence by coming on
their tracks first. But in walking down wind all this is reversed; you
come upon the deer without any warning, and they are almost sure to
smell or hear you long before you discover them. Consequently, as we
expected, we saw nothing on our way here to-day.’</p>

<p>The Skipper’s buck is a very good one, the best that has been killed
at present, and there was much joy at his change of luck. But strictly
speaking his bad luck has pursued him even in this instance, for if he
had not been obliged to shoot when he did, in all probability the rest
of the herd would have appeared
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page207" id = "page207">207</a></span>
on the scene, for their tracks showed that they were following the lead
of this buck. Besides, there is not the same excitement in a chance shot
like this as there is when you first find the deer, and then spend two
or three hours in all kinds of uncomfortable modes of progression in
order to approach them.</p>

<p>However, when we were in this country before the Skipper had all the
good luck, and Esau the bad, the former getting five deer and the latter
only two, so that the present state of affairs may be looked upon as the
working of retributive justice. When this view of the matter was
suggested by Esau to the Skipper, he said, ‘Retributive justice be
blowed!’</p>

<p>We celebrated the joyful reunion of loving hearts by a skaal, and so
to bed, perfectly happy after the events of the day.</p>

<h5>August 27.&mdash;</h5>

<p>We sent the men off this morning with the horse to bring in some of
the meat now lying in the mountains, while we went by canoe to
Gjendesheim to stay for a couple of days, as we cannot go stalking again
till the already slain deer are brought home; the fish in the lake are
not rising well after this long spell of fine weather, and with the
exception of Esau’s ‘home coverts’ there is no shooting for a
fowling-piece at Memurudalen.</p>

<p>Very few tourists find their way to Gjendin, but the season for them
is over, and we expected to have the place to ourselves; but how
fallible is human prescience! To our astonishment the sportsmen from
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page208" id = "page208">208</a></span>
Rus Vand had already occupied the greater part of the house, having
abandoned their own hut for the same reasons which had led us to forsake
our camp, and here they were, armed to the teeth with rods and guns.</p>

<p>This seemed unlucky, and although we were outwardly glad to see them,
at heart we could not help feeling how inconsiderate it was of them to
come and shoot the fjeld and fish the river just when we wanted to do
all that ourselves. No doubt they harboured precisely the same feelings
towards&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>However, we had dinner together, and introduced the ‘boss pie,’ now
rapidly disappearing, to the notice of our Norwegian friends, and as the
meal advanced a feeling of genial contentment crept over us, which
seemed to influence all our senses; we began to talk over sport and
compare our experiences in various countries and in pursuit of various
animals: some of us were good listeners, others fond of talking, but all
animated by a love for the same occupation, so that when at length one
of the enemy handed round the best of cigars, even the Skipper became so
mellow and pleasant that before going to bed we arranged for a joint
shoot after ryper to-morrow; and said ‘Good night,’ feeling that it was
quite fortunate that we had all come to Gjendesheim on the same day.</p>

<p>One of our new friends is a Russian, an engineer officer; he speaks
not the English, but we were introduced to him as a man who had shot
more bears
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page209" id = "page209">209</a></span>
in Europe than any one else living. He has killed forty-two, and looks
as though he had been hugged by each one of them before it finally
succumbed. Now he wants to kill a reindeer, and has been attempting the
feat to-day; apparently he will be <i>hors de combat</i> for the rest of
the week, as he can hardly move for stiffness: he has not been
accustomed to the awful walking that stalking round Gjendin entails.</p>

<p>Esau is also rather dilapidated, for he landed at Leirungsö on his
way down the lake, and walked round the mountain to Gjendesheim, leaving
John to bring on his canoe. On his way he was obliged to wade across the
Leirungs River, a&nbsp;wide and rapid stream, and just in the roughest
part he trod on a loose stone and fell, cutting his knee and making a
bad dent in his gun-barrel. Of course he was wet through and a good deal
hurt, but hardly enough to account for the frightful state of his
temper, till it came out that though he had walked through miles of
beautiful ground for ryper, snipe, and duck, he had never got a shot at
anything.</p>

<h5>August 28.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">This</span> was the hottest, most windless
and cloudless day that has yet been made. The Russian and
F&mdash;&mdash; went out with Esau and the Skipper to shoot ryper,
accompanied by a pointer, which the Norwegians call a bird-hound.
A&nbsp;brood was soon found and rose in front of Esau, who with his
usual promptitude got a right and left; whereupon the Russian took off
his hat, and bowing profoundly, advanced and solemnly shook hands with
him, protesting that he had frequently seen marvellous shooting, but
never, never aught like this; at least, that is what we imagined to be
the translation of the neat little speech which he made in Russian.</p>

<p>A ryper is easier to kill, if possible, than the tamest young grouse
which gets up under a dog’s nose on the calmest 12th of August; and Esau
thinks fame is like an eel on a night-line, easily caught, but very
difficult to hold afterwards.</p>

<p>Satisfied by having witnessed this extraordinary specimen of our
skill, the Russian gave up the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page211" id = "page211">211</a></span>
chase, and returned to Gjendesheim completely exhausted by the heat; but
the others went on till the afternoon, now finding a selfish old cock,
whose fate no one regretted; now a young brood only just old enough to
be shot: anon lying down to rest and eat berries, or bathing in the
Leirungs Lake, but all the time extremely happy.</p>

<p>F&mdash;&mdash; was so exceedingly polite that he would <i>not</i>
shoot unless birds enough for all of us happened to get up at once, and
one brood escaped without a shot being fired, in consequence of our
unwonted emulation of his courtesy.</p>

<p>Near Leirungs we were fortunate enough to drive three large broods
into the same bit of willow scrub, and had some very pretty shooting as
the dog set them one by one; but there was hardly any scent, and the
heat soon proved too much for our bird-hound, so we returned to
Gjendesheim with a very considerable addition to the larder.</p>

<p>Then followed hours of inability to do anything except lie on our
backs with lighted pipes in our mouths, far too exhausted to smoke them;
and at last&mdash;dinner; and soon the cooler air brought relief and
engendered a return of bloodthirstiness, which impelled the gang of
sportsmen to sally forth and rake the river till it was quite rough with
artificial flies.</p>

<p>This was a trying time, for by some means we have established a most
dangerously flattering reputation
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page212" id = "page212">212</a></span>
as fishermen, and were bound to do all we knew to retain it. However,
all turned out right; the Skipper went into the lake and got several
beauties, and Esau did the same in the river, so that we came in with
the best bags by a considerable margin, and could now afford to catch
nothing for a whole day without being dethroned from our pedestal.</p>

<p>The river, Gjendinoset as it is called, just in front of the
rest-house, is a wonderful piece of water; there are about 150 yards of
rapid in which the fish lie, then comes a fall, and below that there are
nothing at present but small fish, though the big ones will soon begin
to drop down lower for spawning. Consequently we all fish in the first
150 yards, and to-day between 50 and 60 lbs. weight has been taken out;
the same quantity yesterday, and probably for some days before; and the
fishing will be even better a few days later, for the Gjende fly is
beginning to hatch, and as long as he lasts the fish will rise well.</p>

<p>We have heard so much of this fly that we had been expecting
something rather gorgeous, a&nbsp;monster dragon-fly, or at least a
second-rate butterfly, or a decent imitation of a stag-beetle; and we
have been looking up gaudy Scotch and Canadian salmon flies, which we
hoped might be passable substitutes; but, alas for the vain hopes of
foolish man! the Gjende fly has come, and he is only a wretched little
black beast like a very small, unenterprising, common or garden
house-fly of Great Britain. He cannot fly decently;
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page213" id = "page213">213</a></span>
he is apparently devoid of sense; he has no moral, physical, or
intellectual attributes for which a human being can learn to respect or
love him; but&mdash;he <i>can</i> <span class =
"smallroman">CRAWL</span>. If he alights on the water it never occurs to
him to rise again, and he allows the trout, mad with the excitement of a
fortnight’s prospective gluttony, to scoop him down their capacious
throats by companies. If he enters your mouth, which he does with a
numerous retinue every time you open it, retreat from that untenable
position is the very last thing he would think of; and with what may be
a gleam of momentary intelligence he seems desirous of still further
increasing his knowledge of the rest of your interior arrangements.</p>

<p>With characteristic obstinacy, unmindful of the teachings of logic,
he invariably acts on the fallacious maxim that ‘an ink-bottle cannot be
so full that there is not room for just one more Gjende fly.’ The whole
of the river here at the end of the lake, and for thirty yards on each
side, is now pervaded by this noisome creature; the water looks as if it
were covered with a mixture of soot and tar, the rocks are black and
slippery with him, and the atmosphere is charged with him, so that the
landscape dimly seen through the cloud looks as if it were dancing.</p>

<p>Gjendesheim itself is unfortunately not quite beyond the zone which
he infests, so that the windows look loathsome with crawling blackness;
the tablecloth is strewn with the corpses of those who have
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page214" id = "page214">214</a></span>
imbibed the honeyed poison of the paraffin lamp and come to an untimely
end, and the remains of the ‘boss pie’ would warrant a stranger in the
belief that it had been composed of currants.</p>

<p>We think Pharaoh must have been a man of extraordinary resolution, or
else inane mildness of character, otherwise he would have sacrificed
Moses long before the fourth Plague was concluded.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Gjende fly has no insatiable craving for human flesh;
the Skipper, indeed, asserted that one fastened on his hand and
inflicted a wound that swelled enormously and remained swollen for
several days, but the better opinion is that the creature that
perpetrated this outrage must have been a viper, though we did not hint
this to the Skipper, because he is firmly convinced that whisky is the
only remedy for snake-bites, and that it must be taken in large
quantities.</p>

<p>If any one stuck up a rod near the river, in two minutes it looked
like a black fir pole with a bunch on the top; and John, who is a man of
great entomological knowledge, spent some time in studying this
phenomenon. He reported that the flies crawled up for fun, intending to
jump off the top ring, but when they got up it was so much higher than
they expected that they were all afraid to try, and those at the bottom
and halfway up kept jeering at the top ones and calling them names, and
jostling them so much that they could not crawl down again. He also said
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page215" id = "page215">215</a></span>
that the swarm in the air was so dense that he wrote his name in it with
his finger, and it remained visible for nearly a minute.</p>

<p>Probably it is difficult for a man to speak the exact truth with his
mouth full of (<b><i>f</i></b>)lies.</p>

<p>When it was too dark to fish we sat round the fire and heard a good
deal about the various winter sports of Norway, capercailzie stalking,
bear hunting, elk and reindeer shooting, and running on skier, the
snow-shoes of the country, which are very different from the well-known
Canadian shoes, being made of wood, from six to twelve feet long, four
inches wide in front, three behind, about an inch and a half thick where
the foot rests, thinner at each end, and turned up and pointed in front.
Every district has its own peculiar shape; about here the right shoe is
made six feet long, the left one ten or eleven feet, it being more easy
to turn if one is shorter than the other: some are made of pine, some of
birch, and occasionally oak. The men of the Thellemarken are the most
skilful runners, but it is now quite a fashionable amusement in
Christiania during the winter, just as skating is in England.</p>

<h5>Sunday, August 29.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Our Norwegian friends departed for the happy hunting-grounds of Rus
Vand this morning, but before doing so they most kindly offered us the
hut there any time after this week, at the end of which they are going
south. We can hardly expect the present glorious weather, which has
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page216" id = "page216">216</a></span>
now lasted for three weeks, to go on for ever; and when the change
comes, a&nbsp;tent will no longer be the abode of comfort and luxury
that we at present find it, so that the offer of the hut is most
opportune for&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>We parted with great regret from people who have been so kind and
hospitable, and many were the expressions of good-will and protestations
of eternal friendship, as we shall not see them again till we pass
through Christiania on our return home.</p>

<p>That return home has caused the Skipper hours of anxious thought
already: there is to be a wedding in England about the end of next
month, at which, although it is not his own, his presence is urgently
needed. He knows he ought to go, but hates to leave this blissful life
just when the best stalking is beginning; consequently he devotes much
time every day to the consideration of the subject, torn by doubts,
tortured by terrible misgivings, and harassed by indecision.</p>

<p>To-day, after being more than usually disagreeable under the malign
influence of his conscience, and seeking for inspiration, first in the
room at Gjendesheim, walking up and down like Weston; then on the lake
paddling like a penny boat; and finally roosting on a rock at the top of
the fjeld with his arms folded like Napoleon, and a gruesome scowl on
his face, or at least on those portions of it which were visible through
the mask of Gjende flies, he at last concluded
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page217" id = "page217">217</a></span>
to commit his fate to the decision of an unbiassed coin, if such could
be obtained from any confiding friend.</p>

<p>With great difficulty he persuaded Esau to lend him one öre, value
1/100 of a shilling, which seems on reckoning to be about half a
farthing; Esau observing as he gave it, ‘It isn’t that I’m stingy, old
fellow, though of course I don’t expect to see it again, but it
<i>will</i> throw my accounts out so.’ N.B.&mdash;Esau’s notion of
keeping accounts is to put his receipts into one pocket, <i>and his
disbursements into another</i>; if he has a vague idea to within
20<i>l.</i> or so of how the money has gone, it will be more than any
one expects; that everything he possesses will be spent is a foregone
conclusion.</p>

<p>But to resume. The öre coin has no distinct head or tail, so the
Skipper named one side heads, and tossed. The thing fell on its edge,
and rolled round the table and about the room till it struck the wall,
whereupon it fell over ‘heads,’ and decided that the Skipper must go to
the wedding.</p>

<p>So he sat down and wrote a letter saying that they must not expect
him, and that he should stay out here the whole time that was originally
intended; for as soon as he had dated the letter it occurred to him that
it would be childish to allow such a weighty matter to be decided by the
whim of a half-farthing coin, which might very likely be interested in
the affair in some way, and which, as he truly said, would
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page218" id = "page218">218</a></span>
possibly have turned up ‘tails’ if it had not happened to fall on its
edge and been interfered with by an unauthorized wall.</p>

<p>Having thus acted according to his inclinations, and given his
missive to Andreas to post when he leaves Gjendesheim next week, the
Skipper became quite pleasant again, and went forth to his fishing ‘ever
and all so gaily&nbsp;O.’</p>

<p>The ponies of Norway are wonderfully docile and clever; these
qualities were well shown to-day in a black one belonging to Jens which
came to take F&mdash;&mdash;’s baggage over the mountain to Rus Vand.
This pony was brought down near the door of the rest-house, and left
standing there without any fastening or any one to look after him. The
things were not ready, so he waited about two hours, occasionally wiping
off the Gjende flies with his tail when their weight became
insupportable, but otherwise never moving. The busy world (consisting of
Andreas and Ragnild) pursued their usual avocations around him, goats
ran against him, and insects climbed over him, but there he stood placid
and motionless as a wooden rocking-horse. At last the baggage was ready,
and they brought it out and piled it on his back until we feared he
would break, and then Jens turned his head in the direction of Rus Vand,
and gave him a gentle push to start him; and he went slowly off up the
mountain, choosing the best way for himself, for no one went with him;
in fact, Jens did not follow him for about half
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page219" id = "page219">219</a></span>
an hour, but no doubt he was found at the right place in the end. The
whole performance reminded one of a clockwork toy, and John remarked as
we stood and watched him out of sight over the pass, ‘Now, that’s what I
call a well-trained pony.’</p>

<p>During our stay here we had the pleasure of forming the acquaintance
of an elk-dog. This animal is taken out in a kind of harness to which a
rope is fastened, the other end of the rope being attached to the
hunter’s belt; and his legitimate occupation is finding elk in a forest
by scent, and denoting their presence by his behaviour before the hunter
gets within range of the elk’s eyes, ears, or nose. Mr. Thomas brought
him up here hoping to find reindeer with him in the same manner, as he
had been unable to get a Finmarker<a class = "star" name = "tag6" id =
"tag6" href = "#note6">*</a> broken to reindeer; but the experiment has
not been successful, for the dog has been so carefully trained to elk,
that he exhibits a large and lofty contempt for so pusillanimous a
creature as a reindeer, and will not confess that he has discovered the
existence of such a thing at all.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a class = "star" name = "note6" id = "note6" href = "#tag6">*</a>
Finmarker is the kind of dog usually employed for finding reindeer: the
name being derived from the district of which it is a native.</p>

<p>But in addition to the fact that he finds no deer, he is a good deal
of trouble from the fastidiousness of his appetite. It appears that he
is accustomed to feed on dogs, and when he cannot get dogs he can rough
it very well for a short time on boys or any
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page220" id = "page220">220</a></span>
other plain fare; but up here, where dogs are few and boys are extinct,
he is having a very poor time of it. The last place where he had a
really square meal was at Skjæggestad, on the journey up, where he was
lucky enough to get a whole dog and some portions of boy; since then he
has only had limbs snatched off adventurous observers, and altogether
seems to be pining for want of proper nourishment. He is about the
height of a colley, but with an enormous chest and limbs, a&nbsp;head
something like an Esquimaux, a&nbsp;wiry reddish yellow coat, and a most
unkindly expression of countenance. In the absence of sufficient flesh
food he appears to be developing a liking for man-diet, so we did not
remain long in his society, for which indeed we only craved after we had
perceived through a chink in the door of his dwelling that he was moored
to a beam by a kind of anchor chain. We have often heard that there is a
certain amount of danger in the pursuit of the elk; if the hunter is
always accompanied by a dog of this kind we can easily understand it.
However, he was a very interesting animal, and if we had a National
School at Memurudalen we should certainly have tried to buy him, as
there is any amount of room for <i>débris</i> there. What a boon he
would be in some of the thickly populated districts of England!</p>

<p>In the afternoon we paddled leisurely back to our camp and found it
looking prettier than ever, but, alas! our little stream had ceased to
run. However,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page221" id = "page221">221</a></span>
there is another one not more than forty yards away, so we shall not be
much troubled by its loss.</p>

<h5>August 30.&mdash;</h5>

<p>The sun still shines upon us from a cloudless sky, and early in the
morning, before any breeze springs up, the lake makes a most beautiful
picture, with its steep mountain sides and foaming torrents so perfectly
reflected in the green unruffled water. But, lovely as it is, its beauty
is rather wasted on us now, for it has been just the same for the last
three weeks, with the outlines all hard and clearly defined, and none of
the graduated effects of distance which we get from the hazy climate at
home: in this clear atmosphere the peaks twenty miles away are as bright
as those a mile or so beyond the lake. Probably this is the reason why
we so seldom see pictures of Norwegian mountain scenery, and that the
few which do appear are often condemned as hard, cold, and
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>The most prominent object in looking towards the lake from our camp
is a curious pyramidal mound, about thirty feet high, close to the
water’s edge. It is so regular in shape that we have devoted many hours
of cogitation and argument to the discovery of its history.</p>

<p>John (who is a man of considerable archæological fame) maintains that
it is a funeral barrow in which some ancient Viking was buried, and he
wants us to give up our cartridges for the purpose of constructing a
mine and blasting him out: we have vainly represented to him that it
cannot be a Viking’s tomb,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page222" id = "page222">222</a></span>
because there is absolutely nothing to Vike up here.</p>

<p>The Skipper says it is a glacial moraine, ‘any donkey can see that at
a glance;’ and Esau holds to the opinion that it is an artificial mound
put up for ancient regiments of Gjendin yeomen and Memurudalen militia
to practise archery at. Possibly none of these theories give the correct
solution; but, whatever its origin, it makes a capital rifle butt for
our occasional shooting. Esau was heard to irreverently remark, as he
aimed at it with the Skipper’s rifle, ‘he guessed an express bullet
would rouse old Jarl Hakon out of that,’ but nothing particular
followed.</p>

<p>To-day the Skipper composed an Irish stew as a <i>pièce de
résistance</i>, which, when it came to table, was unanimously voted the
best of all the excellent dishes on which we have feasted here. After
dinner we made an enormous fire for the sole purpose of warmth, as the
nights are now very cold, and during this fine weather after sunset a
strong draught sets down our valley towards the lake. We have
ascertained that a like draught blows down each of the other valleys
running into Gjendin, making the lake a centre. That in ours begins
gently directly the sun has set, and increases in strength until it
amounts to a stiff breeze; and as it comes direct from the vast snow
fjelds, it is a disagreeably chilly blast, which freezes that side of
our bodies remote from the fire, and leads us to envy the happy
condition of a leg of mutton
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page223" id = "page223">223</a></span>
attached to a roasting-jack. That, ‘o&nbsp;nimium fortunatum!’ enjoys
equally in every part the genial warmth, while man has no mechanical
arrangement by which his immortal soul can be rendered blissful through
the medium of a temperate body.</p>

<p>In the morning a breeze begins to blow out of the lake into all the
valleys; illustrating on a small scale the cause of land and sea breezes
all over the world. The Skipper and John (who is a man of profound
science) have elaborated a theory explaining the exact reason of this
interesting phenomenon; but as their explanation is entirely opposed to
the teachings of Dr. Brewer and the opinions of Professor Tyndall, and
involves a rearrangement of existing notions concerning radiation and
the movements of the heavenly bodies, we think it best to exclude it
from these pages, as this is not a simply scientific work, and we have
no desire to hurt the feelings of even the above-named misguided
philosophers.</p>

with these words ready printed at the top of each page.</p>

<p>The Skipper paddled away to Gjendebod, to bring home the deerskin
which he had left there to dry. He returned with a splendid bag of the
best trout that ever came out of Gjendin, and that means the best in the
world; but he was in a state of great indignation because he had been
charged 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for beds, dinners, and breakfasts for
himself and Öla when they stayed there a few nights ago. This is the
result of living in a cheap country for two months: to the ordinary
Englishman it would not appear an exorbitant hotel bill, especially when
the hotel (!) is fifty miles from a town, and only open for two months
in the year.</p>

<p>Just at bedtime Esau crawled into the tent saying that he had
strained his back in lifting a stone: he was in such pain that he could
hardly stand, and was
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page225" id = "page225">225</a></span>
white and shivering. We undressed him and put him to bed, and then
produced the liniment from the ‘medicine chest,’ by which name we
dignify the cigar-box which contains our little stock of drugs. Then
John spent an hour viciously rubbing remedies into his victim’s back, as
one rubs oil into a bat, so that Esau presently groaned out, ‘Thanks,
John, I&nbsp;think that will do, I&nbsp;feel a great deal better now;’
and certainly he did seem to experience a kind of relief as soon as the
rubbing stopped. After this we turned&nbsp;in.</p>

<h5>September 1.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Esau spent a sleepless night, and this morning could not move.
Thereupon John nobly closed with him for another half-hour’s rubbing,
which had a decided effect, and after giving him some breakfast, we
carried him out and made a comfortable bed for him under the Sycamine
tree, and there left him with the library and all his belongings in easy
reach.</p>

<p>At midday John returned from fishing to lunch with the invalid, and
we wondered how all our friends in England were getting on with the
partridges, and almost wished we were there for a few minutes, as we
pictured to ourselves Eddie and Jack both talking sixteen to the dozen
at lunch over beefsteak pie and beer (fancy beer, John!); old Blank,
with two young dogs tied to him, perspiring over the downs; and the
Major sitting with his cigar aboard the yacht at Cowes, and thinking how
snug his birds were lying down
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page226" id = "page226">226</a></span>
Gorseham way, not to be disturbed till his return next month to shoot at
them, while all the time the Furzely boys were walking them up, and
making them as wild as hawks.</p>

<p>After lunch, John accomplished what has long been his great desire,
the ascent of the sugar-loaf mountain across the Memurua; and after
boiling a thermometer at the topmost peak, burying a pocket handkerchief
(thoughtfully borrowed from Esau, who was too unwell to refuse him
anything), and ‘carving his name on the Newgate Stone with his Tollekniv
fine tra la,’ he returned in raptures about the view, and overcome with
sublime and poetical emotions, which did not subside until he had poured
forth his soul to his two friends at dinner.</p>

<p>The Skipper stalked without success, though he found the tracks of a
good herd that had only just passed over the ground. Though the day was
so pleasant, he had not exactly enjoyed his walk, for he could not help
being filled with gloomy forebodings about Esau; picturing to himself
the difficulties that would arise in getting men to carry the invalid
down to Christiania in a litter, with him yelling at every step. But
behold, how untrustworthy a thing is imagination! when the Skipper
arrived in camp, he was agreeably surprised to find the object of his
solicitude sitting up and actually stirring the rice for the curry, so
marvellous had been the effect of John’s lubrication; assisted by the
support to his back of a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page227" id = "page227">227</a></span>
kind of splint composed of birch bark, a&nbsp;towel, and two straps.</p>

<h5>September 2.&mdash;</h5>

<p>John ate new bread again for dinner yesterday, and the Skipper was
aroused in the middle of the night by a claw reaching out from the
adjoining bed, which clutched his pillow and rug and tried to drag them
away; the whole of this being accompanied by blood-curdling groans and
hideous yells. He became more peaceful after a short time, but the
Skipper is now in mortal fear lest John should again suffer from
indigestion, and again stretch out that gruesome claw, and grabbing him
by the hair, drag him forth from the tent, and with demoniac shrieks
stamp the life out of his frail body, while he makes the quiet valley
re-echo to his triumphant mocking laughter. This, the Skipper asserts,
would be only one step beyond his conduct of last night.</p>

<p>The latest scientific observations have caused us to re-classify the
different altitudes thus:&mdash;First, the country of high cultivation
and wild strawberries; above that the zone of uncleared pine forests and
most of the berries; then the belt of stunted birches and black game;
higher still, that of cows and goats; and above that, the country where
reindeer flourish and snow lies all the year round. This takes us to the
summit of all things earthly, and in this zone there is hardly any
vegetation. Beyond it is the region of eagles, but in the present
incomplete state of human knowledge we have been content to explore this
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page228" id = "page228">228</a></span>
highest zone by letting our spirits soar aloft without our bodies.</p>

<p>Gjendin is just at the highest point of the stunted-birch belt, and
when the wind gets into the N.W. the thermometer, without waiting to
reflect, falls a great distance very hurriedly. John, having no
sheepskin, suffers a good deal from the cold at night; and the
haughtiness of his spirit is so far broken that he now sleeps in two
pairs of trousers, three shirts, and a coat, besides all his rugs.
A&nbsp;few short weeks ago he turned from us with an air of aristocratic
nausea when we were getting into bed clothed in a single shirt and pair
of trousers, donning for his part a linen nightshirt, an effeminacy
previously unheard of in camp life.</p>

<p>These things are changed now, and it is difficult to persuade him not
to go to bed with his boots on; but it has to be prevented on account of
the new bread.</p>

<p>The monotony of an uneventful day was only broken by the occasional
rubbing of Esau’s back, amidst the victim’s agonised appeals for mercy,
as he thinks it is rubbed away to the bone. However, the effect is
magnificent, and he can now hobble about camp and be useful to a certain
extent.</p>

<p>After dinner we dug a small hole in the floor of the outer tent, in
which we placed a spadeful of red-hot embers from the fire. This is a
capital device for obtaining warmth in a tent, as there is no smoke, and
the embers keep glowing for a very long time; possibly it might be
dangerous in a very close-fitting tent, but ours is airy, not to say
hurricany.</p>

<p>Round this fire we sat and talked and smoked until bedtime, hoping
against hope for a few more days of sunshine; but when we turned in, the
wind was howling and moaning along the hill-side in a very ominous and
unpleasant manner.</p>

<h5>September 3.&mdash;</h5>

<p>‘<span class = "firstword">Forty</span> below Nero’ was the probable
position of the thermometer during the night. Esau declares that his
back is quite well, but it is suspected that he only does this in order
to avoid the administration of further remedies by John.</p>

<p>However, we consider this such a successful cure that we here give
our recipe for strained backs to an expectant world, not as a sordid
advertisement, but from pure philanthropic motives.</p>

<p>‘Take the patient and place him on a grassy spot in the sun, and
lubricate with oil; rub this in for three hours with the hand; seize his
wrist and feel the pulse (if you can find it), displaying at the same
time a large gold watch; look profound; mutter inwardly. Now shift him
gently to a shaded position; and having lighted a fire to the windward,
prepare and cook thereon fourteen or fifteen pancakes, and administer
while hot (as a mixture, not a lotion). Take care that the aroma of each
cooking pancake is wafted in the direction of the patient. Carry this
principle
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page231" id = "page231">231</a></span>
throughout all his nourishment. Explain to him that deer abound in the
neighbouring mountains; show him quantities of fresh-caught fish and
newly killed ryper; ensure a week of fine weather, and if this do not
cure him he must be a <i>malade imaginaire</i>.’</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the improvement, of course Esau was not fit to go
stalking, and this and other reasons suddenly induced us to leave
Memurudalen to-day for good, and go to Gjendesheim on our way to Rus
Vand. So we made a last gigantic pie, packed up, lunched, and then
pulled down the tent, which had been standing so long now on the same
spot, and embarked everything on board our two canoes and the
Gjendesheim boat, which had been lent to us. Then the whole fleet sailed
from these hospitable shores ’neath a stormy sky, with cold wind and
rain, and the towering heights of Memurutungen all wrapped in angry
clouds, frowning blackly above&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>It was quite sad to leave the snug little corner where we have spent
such a happy, careless time, with all the comforts which we have added
gradually to our temporary home; and the valley looked very desolate
without the tent, the cheerful fire, and ‘the meteor flag.’</p>

<p>Esau’s last act was to fill two brass cartridge cases with water and
hammer them firmly into each other; the air-tight boiler so formed he
put into the fire under the oven, and after waiting a short time for the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page232" id = "page232">232</a></span>
explosion, forgot all about it and went away without telling any one.
Just then John arrived at the spot to see if there were any loose
belongings lying about, and was horrified to observe the oven suddenly
elevate itself into the air and disappear among the clouds with a loud
report. His mind at once reverted to the happy life of a landlord in co.
Limerick, but he soon realised the true state of affairs, and came down
to the lake muttering something about ‘tomdamfoolery,’ a&nbsp;Norwegian
word which expresses censure of the silly custom of practical
joking.</p>

<p>This morning we found a merlin sitting just outside the tent door; it
had evidently been stuffing itself with scraps of offal from the camp
until it was perfectly stupid and could scarcely fly. Esau wanted to
knock it on the head at first, but more humane feelings came over him,
so he fetched his rifle and shot it for an hour or so, till at length
the bird, wearied by the constant noise, retired into the birch woods,
and we saw it no more.</p>

<p>There are usually several ravens near the camp, which come down to
‘carry off carrion,’ but otherwise there are not many birds here: the
most common are buzzards and kestrels, which abound; two eagles, which
are generally soaring above Memurutungen; a&nbsp;pair of ospreys
occasionally flying about the lake; a&nbsp;rough-legged buzzard seen
once, a&nbsp;few merlins, and a small short-tailed red hawk, with whom
we are not acquainted; sometimes black-throated divers and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page233" id = "page233">233</a></span>
scaups on the lake, and a few fieldfares and redwings in the birch
woods. We have found many nests of the latter in the trees, and one of a
fieldfare in a bank.</p>

<p>What rare times all the birds and beasts of prey will have for the
next few days in Memurudalen! only to be equalled by the early days of
the Australian gold fever. Nuggets of inestimable value in the shape of
heads, tails, and other portions of reindeer, ryper, duck, and
trout&mdash;intermingled with other delicacies, such as potato skins,
jam and marmalade pots, and whisky bottles&mdash;will from time to time
be unearthed amidst shrieks of triumph. ‘Claims’ will be run up to a
fabulous price, and many a battle royal will be fought in that happy
valley where we have spent a month of peace. As we depart in mournful
silence, brooding over the days that are no more, we see in fancy the
numerous bright eyes which from lairs and eyries are watching our every
move, their owners all ready to swoop down on our <i>débris</i> as soon
as we have passed out of sight.</p>

<p>The lake was very rough, and we were quite afraid of being swamped
and losing our baggage from the magnitude of the big little waves; but
luckily the boat took our heaviest things, or we should not have been
able to venture; and so the canoes, lightly loaded and with all sail
set, rode gallantly o’er the foaming billows, and we all got safe to
Gjendesheim. The cheery fire in the room, with its bare wooden walls and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page234" id = "page234">234</a></span>
benches, made a picture which seemed the perfection of comfort after the
chilly tent and the freezing N.W. wind.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>‘It is the black north-wester</p>

</div>

<p>One of the party is always telling us that he intends to inflict on
the British public a narration of our experiences on this expedition,
and although he has not yet begun to collect materials for the work, we
have begun to invent titles for the book that is to be. One is ‘England,
Canada, and Norway,’ being a description of Englishmen travelling in
Norway with Canadian canoes; and we think this title might induce
schoolmasters to buy it, under the impression that it is a geographical
treatise on those countries.</p>

<div class = "para">
The Skipper proposed ‘The Fool with the Fowling-piece, or Fishing and
Flyblows.’ John’s title was ‘Mems. from Memurudalen, or Jottings from
the Jotunfjeld;’ and Esau suggested ‘Glopit, top it, and mop it,’
alluding, he said, to the state of John’s forehead whenever he arrived
at the summit of that mountain; but the explanation was received with
such a chorus of

<td class = "middle">‘Oh!</td>

</div>

<p>One notion is to make the book a collection of cooking recipes for
camp life, and call it ‘Grunts from a Gourmand in Gulbrandsdalen, or
Paragraphs
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page235" id = "page235">235</a></span>
from the Pen of a Pig;’ but we think we should promote a more active
sale among respectable people if it were called ‘Self-Improvement, or
Lights thrown on Good Living.’</p>

<p>Another idea is that it might get a sale by appearing surreptitiously
among the Christmas books for the young, and for that purpose we should
use the names of our two henchmen Anglicised. ‘Oola and Eva: a&nbsp;Tale
for Girls,’ could not fail to attract the favourable attention of
parents and guardians.</p>

<p>Possibly it might create a greater sensation if it were introduced to
the world as ‘Julia and Pausanias: an Idyll.’ It is very difficult to
decide on a good name, but we are all agreed that the name once found,
it will be perfectly easy to write the book afterwards.</p>

<h5>September 4.&mdash;</h5>

<p>How soothing and pleasant it is, when we hear the storm and rain
shrieking and beating outside, to reflect that there is a good solid
roof over our heads, and that we shall not be roused in the night by the
cry of ‘All hands turn out to slack off guy-ropes!’</p>

<p>This morning the lake was so rough that we perceived that we had been
very lucky to make our voyage yesterday; we certainly could not have
attempted it to-day. The man from Gjendebod was here, and started for
the other end of the lake with Andreas in the big boat about nine
o’clock, but at two they came back dead beat and wet through,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page236" id = "page236">236</a></span>
having been obliged to desist from their attempt before they had gone
two miles, and they considered themselves lucky to have got back.</p>

<p>The appearance of the lake is wonderfully fine as the white-capped
breakers come rolling in, flinging the spray high up the face of the
opposing cliffs, and dashing with an angry roar against the black rocks
where they jut out into the deep part of the lake. The Skipper,
affirming that he could smell the salt in the air, began to look out
pollack-flies, while John put on a beautiful brand-new shooting coat,
and went down to the shore to pick up seaweed and dig on the sands: he
came back saying that the tide was coming
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page237" id = "page237">237</a></span>
in, and he thought he had seen the smoke of a steamer in the offing.</p>

<p>Close to this end of the lake a little promontory runs out, which
forms a breakwater, so that the sea just opposite the house is
comparatively calm. In this bay, directly after breakfast, we saw two
scaups, and the Skipper and Esau manned a canoe to try for them, the
former to paddle, the latter to shoot. Only one was shot at, and it
managed to fly beyond the headland before falling dead, and we dare not
go after it in our frail craft.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we took all the male inhabitants of this district,
viz. Öla, Ivar, and Andreas, to act as spaniels and retrievers, and went
into the fjeld above Gjendesheim for ryper. We had quite a sporting
afternoon, as we managed to find a good many broods: the strong wind had
made them so much wilder that they got up with reasonable haste and
energy, instead
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page238" id = "page238">238</a></span>
of waiting to be kicked and then only running away.</p>

<img src = "images/pic238.png" width = "535" height = "414"
alt = "Ola and Andreas capturing a wounded Grouse"></p>

<p>We had great fun also in watching the behaviour of our men,
especially their method of capturing a wounded bird. One which was hit
in the head had dropped among some rocks, and Öla and Andreas went in
pursuit; they crawled suspiciously about, peering over the stones as if
they were stalking reindeer; then suddenly catching sight of the bird,
which was crouching down as birds hit in the head sometimes do, they
advanced cautiously upon it, each with an uplifted stick in his hand,
and crept like assassins nearer and nearer to their victim. At last they
stood within reach. Öla gave the word to strike, and strike
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page239" id = "page239">239</a></span>
they did, as if they were breaking stones, and the poor old ryper lay at
the feet of its murderers a mangled, bleeding corpse.</p>

<p>We shot all the afternoon with almost unvarying luck, hardly ever
losing a bird; now getting four barrels into a large brood, now picking
up a solitary old cock that had selfishly separated himself from his
family, and selected a particularly advantageous feeding-ground for his
own exclusive benefit, and at intervals having a little recreation
afforded by our men, especially the professional buffoon, Ivar.</p>

<p>In one marshy bit of ground a pair of short-eared owls were
incautious enough to fly up in front of Esau, and were promptly added to
the bag; they were in beautiful plumage, which was luckily not injured
by the shot, so we were much pleased at getting them. Then we went
towards the river into the ground frequented by ducks, and got a little
shooting there, and finished the day by walking round the shoulder of
the lower fjeld about the time that the ryper were coming there to feed,
and so back to Gjendesheim. Altogether the walk was most enjoyable, and
as we returned and gazed over Gjendin, the contrasts of storm and
sunshine, tumbled clouds and rough waters, and occasional glimpses of
the highest mountains gleaming through rifts in the surrounding
blackness as the bright sunbeams lighted up their peaks of snow, formed
the most striking
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page240" id = "page240">240</a></span>
picture of wild and desolate grandeur that can be imagined.</p>

<p>Esau’s shooting is remarkably unerring, and we feel so annoyed with
him sometimes when he <i>won’t</i> miss even a palpably difficult
chance, that we were quite glad a few days ago when he took such a long
shot that it strained his gun, and the Skipper exclaimed, ‘Ah,
I&nbsp;told you you would, I’ve been expecting it all along.’</p>

alt = "John and the Skipper upsetting in the Canoe"></p>

<p>John had an unstrung kind of day. Starting down the river to fish
soon after breakfast, he became so engrossed in his sport that he forgot
all about lunch, and did not return till dinner-time, when he walked
abstractedly into the room where we were
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page241" id = "page241">241</a></span>
sitting, and pulled out his watch; then after studying it and making
calculations for a short time he remarked slowly, ‘I&nbsp;left here at
six minutes past ten, and hanged if it isn’t ten minutes past six now;
my watch must have stopped.’ Then he wandered off upstairs to his room,
still ruminating over this extraordinary occurrence to his watch; but in
his absence Ragnild had changed all his things into another cabin
without telling him anything about it, so that he found his old
habitation swept and garnished, and began to think, like Clever Alice,
‘This is none of I.’ However, he got over this difficulty and came down
to dinner, still looking a trifle abstracted, but with his usual
appetite. Afterwards the Skipper paddled him across the river to fish,
and when coming back, John upset the canoe and nearly drowned them both
in the presence of Esau and every native in the district, who joined in
mocking them in the Norwegian tongue from the bank.</p>

<p>Finally he informed us that during his wanderings he had composed a
short poem, ‘which,’ said he, ‘as you have not heard it, I&nbsp;will now
proceed to recite.’</p>

<p>So we went to bed.</p>

<span class = "subhead">RAPID-RUNNING.</span></h3>


<h5>Sunday, September 5.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">To</span>-day the Skipper and Esau
determined to try to run the canoes down the river to Sjödals Lake,
where we intend to leave them during our stay at Rus Vand.</p>

<p>All things being ready, the Skipper started about eleven o’clock on
his perilous voyage, closely followed by Esau. The river is full of
impracticable falls, some of them twenty or thirty feet high, but
between these places there are splendid rapids, and the excitement of
running them is delightfully fascinating. When we came to a bad fall we
carried the canoes round, and enlisted the services of our two men to
help us in this part of the performance. Öla did not like this at all,
for carrying a canoe of 80 lbs. weight over very rough ground is hard
work, and Öla loveth the fireside and the odour of roasting coffee
better than hard work on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Presently we came to a place which the Skipper wanted to run, but
which Esau declared to be too dangerous; it was a very swift and rocky
rapid, with
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page243" id = "page243">243</a></span>
two extremely sudden turns, the lower of which was only a few yards
above a high fall. Esau only ran past the first turn, which was quite
nervous work enough, and then got to shore and waited on the bank for
the result of the Skipper’s exploit.</p>

<p>Down he came at about fifteen miles an hour, took the first turn most
successfully, and then, by some extraordinary strokes of his paddle,
which no man living but himself could have performed, and aided by a
species of miracle, he got round the second; but then an eddy caught the
canoe, and she became unmanageable, so that instead of stopping in a
little creek of quiet water as he intended, he came straight on at a
terrific speed, and ran high and dry on a ledge of rock just above the
fall, losing his paddle at the shock. Wonderful to relate, the canoe was
not a bit injured, but the paddle whirled over the abyss and disappeared
for ever; and the Skipper was pleased because he had not done the
same.</p>

<p>We spent five hours in this kind of amusement, and enjoyed it almost
more than anything else we have done. The constant danger of a smash or
an upset, the sensation of speed, the delight of the sudden rush to the
gliding dip over a fall, with the water roaring past a rock on each
side; the big waves below the fall, which catch the canoe and toss it
from one to another till you feel as if you must be thrown out; and the
curious appearance that the hurrying foam-flecked waters all round
present, combine
<span class = "pagenum">

to make Sunday rapid-running a very popular pursuit.</p>

<p>While we were doing the last bit above Sjödals Lake, our men,
instigated no doubt by Öla the Lazy, seized the opportunity given by a
long rapid to go home, and as we were pretty well tired out with our
exertions, we left the canoes above the lowest fall and walked back to
Gjendesheim. But we cannot recommend this river to future voyageurs;
there are too many places that cannot be run; and we hear that we are
regarded as decidedly mad for having attempted&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Öla, our stalker, is a man whom we do not much admire. He is a big,
handsome fellow, with a light beard and moustache, and rather a weak
face; and his good qualities are extreme cleverness at almost any kind
of work&mdash;carpentry, smith’s work, needlework, and saddlery, all
seem to come alike to him&mdash;and as
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page245" id = "page245">245</a></span>
a deer-stalker he is first-rate, and never makes a mistake. But we fear
that his profession at home is to be an independent gentleman, and he is
very lazy, and nearly always sulky. This sulkiness annoys us more than
anything else, but we also get very angry with him for being afraid of
everything. He is afraid to go in the canoes, and nothing has ever
induced him to enter either of them. He is afraid of rowing against a
wind, or going out stalking on two successive days, lest he should tire
himself; and he is afraid of washing up plates and pans lest he should
lose dignity, but it does not bore him to sit by and watch other people
perform the operation.</p>

<p>The Gjende fly was a marvellous sight to-day; we thought him numerous
before, but we little knew the accumulated villany of which this noxious
creature is capable. Every fly that we saw here a week ago has now got a
large and healthy family of some hundreds, and a darkness which may be
felt broods over the river and its shores. And now that the cold weather
has set in, he begins to perceive that his short but effectual career of
annoyance draws near to its close, and the whole face of nature is
covered with torpid crawling things, that make one turn in disgust from
everything one touches. May his end come soon, for we love him not.</p>

<p>We are very comfortable here at night sitting round the noble
fireplace in the corner of the room. These corner fireplaces are found
in every sæter and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page246" id = "page246">246</a></span>
homestead in this part of the country, and are very picturesque and
cheery, vastly superior to the modern stove, that may be seen standing
up gaunt and inhospitable in every house in more civilised regions. Most
of them have the chimney supported by a crooked piece of birch wood
coming down from the roof and hooked underneath the projecting angle of
stonework, but in some there is instead an upright iron bar from the
hearth. Generally speaking, they are placed quite against the wall in
the corner, but we have seen several
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page247" id = "page247">247</a></span>
with a space behind large enough to walk through, and one which even had
a bed behind&nbsp;it.</p>

<h5>September 6.&mdash;</h5>

<p>The sea on Gjendin has organised something remarkably like a ground
swell under the influence of the continuous storm, and its fury is more
magnificent than ever; no boat here would have a chance of living
in&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Esau spent the morning packing his bird-skins in a wooden box for
their journey home, as we hardly expect to get much more in the way of
specimens. Then we had another afternoon at ryper, not quite so lucky as
yesterday, but still satisfactory. When we returned we found that
Andreas had brought from Besse Sæter a vast pile of literature which had
been accumulating at the Vaage post office for the last month. After
dinner, when we were all buried in our respective letters and papers,
occasionally reading out particularly interesting scraps of news,
Ragnild came in and informed us that a certain Norwegian, whom we may
call Mr. Fox, had come there to fish. This was a man who had done some
business for us here two years ago, and we had had a little
correspondence with him before coming out this year. Thinking we might
have given him some trouble, and not having any great liking for his
character, we naturally wished to be especially civil to him; so we
asked Ragnild to bring him in and stay to interpret for&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>Presently he entered the room, and after greeting us sat down and
refused to have anything to drink:
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page248" id = "page248">248</a></span>
this astonished us so much that it completely drove our small stock of
smaller talk out of our heads. The commonplaces of polite conversation
sound perfectly ridiculous when gravely uttered to an interpreter for
transmission to the proper recipient, and so Ragnild seemed to think,
for her translation always sounded much shorter than our flowery
sentences. We tried a variety of feeble questions to which we already
knew the answers, somewhat in the following style:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘We presume, Mr. Fox, that you like Norwegian cheese?’</p>

<p>‘Does your brother also like Norwegian cheese?’</p>

<p>‘Do you speak German?’</p>

<p>‘No? but your brother, we believe, plays the Norwegian
german-flute?’</p>

<p>‘The friends of your sister’s children are also our friends. They
live in England, but we believe they still like Norwegian cheese.’</p>

<p>‘We like much the cheese of the country, and have never suffered
asphyxia from&nbsp;it.’</p>

<p>‘We shall take a small quantity with us to England for the
destruction of rats;’ and so forth.</p>

<p>Presently Esau, getting impatient, suggested in a loud voice that we
should ‘ask him some questions out of Bennett’s Phrase-book.’ Then he
was covered with shame, as he feared that Ragnild would immediately
translate this to Mr. Fox; but fortunately she did not.</p>

<p>On reference later to the said Phrase-book we
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page249" id = "page249">249</a></span>
find that some very appropriate and useful sentences may be gleaned from
its fertile pages. For instance, ‘Who are you? What sort of weather is
it to-day?’ (these two remarks are introductory, as it were, and to
inspire confidence in the person addressed). Then we come to the point:
‘Will you lend me a dollar? Be quick! Thank you, you are very kind.’
Here the speaker would turn to Ragnild and proceed thus: ‘Put this in my
carpet bag. Make haste and bring me a light, open, four-wheeled phaeton
carriage, drawn by one horse.’ Then to Mr. Fox, ‘Good morning;
I&nbsp;must go, but I shall return in a month.’ Then the speaker might
wink at John and depart.</p>

<p>Now came the most awful pause that the history of the world in its
darkest moments can yet point to. We coughed and glared at each other,
and felt in our pockets as if we might find something to say there; and
then the Skipper had a brilliant idea, and said, ‘Ask Mr. Fox how long
he intends to stay here.’ But Ragnild at once replied, ‘Only two days,’
without referring the question to him at all; so that remark was wasted,
and our embarrassment became worse than ever; for now not only had we to
invent subjects of conversation, but also to put them in such a form
that Ragnild should not be able to answer them without taking Mr. Fox
into her confidence. He all the time was most annoying, as he would do
literally nothing to keep up his end of the conversation, and replied to
our lengthiest and most brilliant efforts of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page250" id = "page250">250</a></span>
exuberant verbosity by monosyllables and inarticulate grunts.</p>

<p>At last, in desperation we presented him with a very nice new English
knife, for which he did not seem to care at all; and so we parted, both
sides feeling that the interview had been a failure.</p>

<p>The following note is extracted from one of the journals:&mdash;‘The
common cheese of Great Britain is unknown in Norway, but in the roadside
inn, the smallest sæter or farmhouse, and the humble cottage dwelling,
the traveller can always obtain that excellent substitute, the
goat’s-milk cheese of the country.’ The colour of this excellent
substitute is that of Windsor soap; its consistency, leather; and its
scent, decomposed glue, which causes the natives to keep it under a
glass shade. If you eat it, your own dog will shun you; if you avoid it,
you starve.</p>

<h5>September 7.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Esau always wakes up in the most boisterous spirits, and as the
partitions between the cabins are only made of thin boards full of
knot-holes, he can be heard all over the house the first thing in the
morning jeering at John, who sleeps next door, whistling, and crowing
like a baby in his cot: he continues these little games long after
breakfast-time, and though he is wide awake, will <i>not</i> get up. All
this sounds very pleasant and cheery to talk about, but the Skipper, who
usually wakes in a temper the reverse of angelic, being influenced by an
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page251" id = "page251">251</a></span>
unequal liver, wishes that these walls were twice as thick, and that
Esau was at Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Generally he tries little stratagems to induce Esau to get up,
dressing operations having a tendency to quiet him. Sometimes he enters
the room sniffing, and remarks, ‘How deuced good the coffee smells
roasting!’ or ‘We’re going to have a tip-top fish for breakfast, but
there’s very little of that pie left; enough for two of us p’raps’ (this
would mean about eight pounds). Or he looks out of the window, and
assuming an attitude of intense surprise, hanging on to the frame like
Irving in ‘the Bells,’ says, ‘By George, Esau! there’s a fellow just
below looking through a binocular that can give yours six lengths for
mechanism.’ If all these expedients fail, he gives in, and dresses
quickly with his ears full of tow, leaving Esau aloft, and gets into the
eating-room, where the floor and ceiling between put a soft pedal on
operatic selections.</p>

<p>Esau says all this ill-feeling arises because the Skipper cannot
whistle Berlioz’s ‘Faust,’ and is jealous.</p>

<p>Andreas and Ragnild are making preparations for their departure,
which takes place to-morrow; then Gjendesheim will be closed, the door
fastened, the windows shuttered, and the place will be left to itself
until next June. Very soon now Gjendin will be covered with ice and
snow: most of the good folks in the sæters have already gone to the
valleys for the winter.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page252" id = "page252">252</a></span>
<p>We thought it would be more convenient for them if we took our
departure to-day, so packed our goods on the pony and said ‘Farvel’ to
Gjendesheim. Our last view of Gjendin, as we turned to look from the top
of the pass, was just as it appeared when we first saw it&mdash;black,
gloomy, and forbidding, with the cold north wind sweeping in a hurricane
over its waters, and heavy rain-clouds hanging over its mountain
shoulders, making a scene as awfully lonely and desolate as it is
possible to depict.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<img src = "images/pic252.png" width = "480" height = "376"
alt = "Jens and his Pony on their way over Bes Fjeld"></p>

<p>After the pony had gone with the last load we suddenly discovered
that the tent had been forgotten: it and its appurtenances make a
package weighing about 70 lbs. Now we <i>all</i> hate carrying 70
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page253" id = "page253">253</a></span>
lbs., but fortunately at this crisis a <i>deus ex machinâ</i> appeared
in the person of a stranger. At first we thought it must be one of our
own men returning for something after changing his coat, but on his
nearer approach we found that he was the rest of the population of the
district, whom we had not seen before, coming down in a body. This was
Hans Kleven, who has the reputation of being the best hunter in the
country. He is a small sturdy man, with amazing shoulders and a
pleasant, good-humoured face, and a most gorgeous check shooting-coat,
of a pattern so enormous that there are only three squares on the whole
of his back, which is a pretty broad one. This coat was given to him
years ago, apparently about 1840, by an English sportsman, and he is as
proud of it as ever Joseph was of his celebrated garment. To him we
committed our tent, which he carried over to Besse Sæter, three miles
away, without turning a hair. We rewarded him with a shilling, and from
his profuse gratitude we conjecture that he only expected fourpence for
the job.</p>

<p>Our first step at Besse Sæter was, as usual, to demand food; and John
asked for a dish called ‘Tuk melk,’ which had been recommended to him as
very Norwegian and very good. A&nbsp;woman at once went to fetch it from
the other sæter, a&nbsp;quarter of a mile away, and presently brought it
in a large wooden milk-tub about the size and shape of a sitz bath. How
that poor woman carried it we know not; it occupied
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page254" id = "page254">254</a></span>
half the table, and was so scrupulously clean that we feared to touch it
with our sordid hands.</p>

<p>John and Esau at last attacked it in the orthodox manner, which is to
sit on opposite sides of the table, and to draw a line across the
surface of the milk with a spoon before beginning, and then to ‘eat
fair’ up to that line. It would have amused some of our friends at home
if they could have seen these two young men of fashion at the moment
when both of them were engaged with abnormally large wooden spoons,
silently ladling down ‘Tuk melk’ out of a tub as big as a drawing-room
table.</p>

<p>They reported that it was on the whole good; something like curds,
but with a sourer taste, and it was much improved by sugar; but though
they ate a large quantity of it, being men of great courage and
determination, they could not persuade the Skipper to risk his life in
experiments with untried articles of food. He, however, gave utterance
to the following refined expression of his sentiments:&mdash;‘I wouldn’t
touch that beastliness if you gave me fourteen pence a spoonful to
swallow it.’ No one offered the reward.</p>

<p>Out shooting on the other side of the lake, we put up a snipe just at
evening, which went down again close to us. This species of game is not
common up here, although we find his cousin the woodcock fairly often;
consequently we were much excited, and advanced upon the foe with
insidious step, and bloodthirsty weapons almost at our shoulders in
order
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page255" id = "page255">255</a></span>
to slay him as soon as he should rise. All went well, and at the right
moment up he got, and promptly did the Skipper fire and miss him; while
Esau’s gun for the first time on record missed fire, and left him using
language that ought to have ignited any cartridge. So the happy bird
zigzagged off into the dim shades of sheltering night, and we went on
our way full of thought and sorrow.</p>

<p>Arriving again at the sæter after narrowly escaping shipwreck in the
passage, we found that Jens had come to meet us, and as he will enter
our service from this date, we shall no longer need Ivar, and paid him
off, arranging, however, that he is to come to help us home when we
leave Rus Vand.</p>

<p>We like Ivar very much now, though we did not by any means dote upon
him at first. Ivar is a good fellow, but an idiot, perfectly willing to
do anything in the world, but not understanding <i>how</i> to do
anything. His budding reputation was blasted in our eyes the first time
that we left camp and entrusted everything to his care: we were away for
three days, and in that time he consumed nearly four pounds of our best
butter; on our return we decided that he was a knave, but we have since
learnt that it was only his natural impulsiveness that led him to commit
such an outrage; and now that we have found how eager he is to oblige us
in everything, we like his strange nature better than Öla’s awful
laziness of character. He came into the room this morning to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page256" id = "page256">256</a></span>
stand for his portrait, and the easy, graceful attitude that he assumed
for the occasion was inimitable. His waistcoat and boots were perhaps
his greatest charm, but his open countenance and genial smile (six
inches in diameter) played no small part in causing him to become
beloved by us as he was.</p>

<p>Ivar always laughed like a nigger on a racecourse, and whenever we
took him out ryper-shooting he was exactly like an unbroken retriever:
if a bird was killed, he <i>would</i> rush in to gather it, and we had
to shout, ‘Back, Ivar, back! Lie down! Down charge!’ to prevent him
disturbing any birds that might have chanced to remain during the yells
and convulsions of Christy Minstrel mirth into which the death of a
ryper always sent him. His behaviour usually made us laugh so much that
we attributed any missing to the unsteadiness caused by constant
hilarity. We gave him our spade as a parting present, and dismissed him
with our blessing.</p>

<h5>September 8.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">This</span> morning we crossed the fjeld to
Rus Vand in a gale of wind. Waving a ‘Farvel’ to the kindly folk at
Besse Sæter, we have a stiff climb up by the side of the torrent which
comes gadareneing<a class = "star" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href =
"#note7">*</a> down from Bes Lake, high above our heads, and presently
we stand on the open fjeld above the sæter. Below lie the green waters
and birch-clad banks of Sjödals Lake; far away to the east the great
fall and larger trees that mark the outlet of the lake; and still
further, glimpses of lower Sjödals Lake, with its forests of pine, haunt
of the black game and capercailzie. But we cannot stand long to look,
for the side of a Norwegian mountain, though eminently suited to
hurricanes, is extremely <i>un</i>suitable for human beings while the
stormy winds do blow. En avant, Messieurs, en avant! and we fight our
way across the flat top to the opposite brow. Here we must pause, though
Æolus himself say nay. ‘What a glorious sight!’ Straight in front, the
cloud-girt peak of Nautgardstind,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page258" id = "page258">258</a></span>
all glistening white with newly fallen snow, but of him only the top can
be seen; his middle is hidden by a never-ending rush of scudding clouds.
Higher still and westward the jagged summits of Tyknings Hö and
Memurutind, also pure white where the snow can lie, but with huge black
lines and chasms where the steep rocky face stands up gaunt and
repellent, so sheer that snow can never lodge; nearer the tremendous
mass of Bes Hö frowns above us; and far below in front the Russen River
winds its way through barren rocks and patches of willow, to warmer and
more hospitable regions, leaving with a leap of joy the cold
storm-rocked Rus Lake, which has been its cradle since its birth in the
mighty glaciers around.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a class = "star" name = "note7" id = "note7" href = "#tag7">*</a>
Gadareneing, <i>i.e.</i> rushing violently down a steep place.</p>

<p>Such was the scene lying before us on the north side of the mountain,
grand beyond description, perhaps the finest in Norway, but not exactly
inviting to shivering hungry mortals, so not much time was spent on it.
Down we went, with the wind worse than on the other side, howling past
our ears and screeching in the gun-barrels, and at last arrived at the
lake to find Jens hauling for his life at the boat which, though filled
with water by the breakers, had fortunately not been battered to pieces
on the rocky strand. He had left it dragged up on the beach out of the
water, but the sea had increased so much in his absence, that if we had
been a little later it would without doubt have been smashed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page259" id = "page259">259</a></span>
<p>However, we soon baled her out, and with Öla as Charon commenced the
passage. Rusvasoset, as the outlet is called, is not more than 60 yards
across, but the waves had had seven miles of very open water to get up
in, and they came rolling down to this end in a very alarming manner.
With great difficulty we shoved off, and then with Öla sculling his
hardest, and the Skipper keeping our head to wind, we at last got safe
across with no mishap but the loss of Öla’s hat and a thorough ducking
for all of&nbsp;us.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "pic259" id = "pic259">&nbsp;</a><br>
<img src = "images/pic259.png" width = "501" height = "314"
alt = "A Stormy Crossing at Rusvasoset"></p>

<p>Öla was very sorrowful about his hat, which was of pure Leghorn
straw, double seamed, extra quality lining; and being further
embellished with a black braid ribbon, it was a great source of pride to
him; but we mocked when it flew away, and are inclined to bear its
departure with equanimity, and hope it will
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page260" id = "page260">260</a></span>
be accepted as a propitiatory offering by the angry Lady of the
Lake.</p>

<p>All the things were at last safely housed, and we soon made ourselves
comfortable in our new abode, which is luxury itself in this weather
when compared with a tent.</p>

<p>There are two huts, one by the edge of the lake, the other about 20
yards away, and it is the latter which we occupy. We enter by a door
about five feet high, invariably knocking our heads against the lintel
and swearing as we do so. The first room is about nine feet square, with
a narrow dresser under the solitary window on the left, and an iron
cooking stove in the nearest corner to the right, the more remote one
being tenanted by a bed. Round the room at various heights are shelves
and hooks adorned by cooking utensils of all kinds, very kindly left for
us by their worthy owners; two or three stools complete the furniture;
and on the floor are to be seen carved the effigies of departed trout of
fabulous weight, with dates and the initials of their captors. Passing
on through a still smaller doorway we find ourselves in another room of
the same size, but with three beds instead of one, and an open Norwegian
fireplace; the same kind of pegs and shelves, and hooks for guns on the
wall; more profile fishes, and walls covered with records in pencil of
game killed by former inhabitants, with occasional amusing notes. This
is our dining, drawing, and bed room; the other is only used as
kitchen.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page261" id = "page261">261</a></span>
<p>The men’s hut near the water is also divided into two rooms: the
outer and much larger compartment is used as a cellar, larder, and
general store-room, and presents, to say the least of it,
a&nbsp;somewhat untidy appearance, as bottles, barrels, and boards,
a&nbsp;grindstone, reindeer bones, a&nbsp;saw, a&nbsp;side-saddle, and
old nets are piled together without any attempt at order. The inner room
is very small, about nine feet by four, and there our two men sleep; and
there also is a large oven built of stone, and heated by a fire inside
it. As we had no bread, we proceeded to bake, and our ignorance of the
manners and customs of this oven caused the bread to have a terribly
trying time of it; for we did not make it hot enough at the first
attempt, and the bread was left lying on the top covered by a cloth for
over an hour while the oven was being heated a second time.</p>

<p>All’s well that ends well, and this batch of rolls turned out the
very best that frail man ever tasted, and consequently at supper we ate
enough bread and butter and jam to supply a school feast of the
hungriest description.</p>

<p>While the Skipper and John attended to the loaves Esau looked after
the fishes, and very soon got a nice dish of half-pounders in the river.
As he came back something in the middle of the stream caught his eye.
‘It is, yet it can’t be&mdash;yes, by George, it is, Öla’s hat!’ wedged
in between two rocks, and slightly out of shape, but with the
double-seamed, extra quality lining
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page262" id = "page262">262</a></span>
uninjured, and the pure Leghorn straw in very fair condition. The
effusion with which Öla received it was a sight to be seen, but no one
else exhibited much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>An inventory of our remaining stores reveals the fact that we have
heaps of everything except coffee and bacon, which can only last about a
week longer. In view of this happy state of things the Skipper proposed
to spend a week of wild and reckless profusion and sinful
extravagance.</p>

<p>Esau at once pictured himself seated on a grassy slope giving way to
Epicurean indulgence, surrounded by three untouched pots of jam, and
eating from a fourth with a table-spoon; at his side a cup of tea
blacker than ink, and flavoured with condensed milk thicker than cream,
while he flipped lumps of sugar into the water instead of pebbles, and
commanded Öla to sand the floor of the hut with pepper.</p>

<p>John suggested as an amendment that we should make some exception to
show that we possess the power of self-denial. ‘Let us,’ said he, ‘deny
ourselves in some one thing. Not in luxuries, which are getting scarce;
in that there would be no merit. No; rather let us exercise our virtue
in respect of what we have in the greatest abundance, and thereby show a
great and shining example to the world. Let us abstain entirely from
water.’ (He had ascertained that there was plenty of whisky.)</p>

<p>Esau rose to oppose the remarks of the honourable
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page263" id = "page263">263</a></span>
gentleman. ‘Such self-denial would be a good action, but the constant
performance of virtuous actions tends to make one haughty. I&nbsp;dare
say you fellows don’t know this, but I do, because I’ve tried it.
I&nbsp;prefer to be wicked and humble.’</p>

<p>The motion was not pressed to a division.</p>

<p>We are well provided with all kinds of food, for we found in the
larder a shoulder of venison, and we have any amount of ryper, which, as
John says, ‘will save our bacon, though they could not save their own;’
and so with a comfortable hut to live in, a&nbsp;river full of fish at
our door, and a blazing fire to sit round, life assumes a rosy hue, and
we go to sleep in real beds with bright hopes of the future.</p>

<p>The Skipper was heard to murmur as he turned over to sleep,
‘I&nbsp;say, what bread that is! When I get home I shall publish a
pamphlet, and teach all the world to bake like that.’</p>

<p>It is rather rough on the Skipper’s pamphlet to publish his recipe
here, but this is copied from his journal:&mdash;</p>

<h5>September 9.&mdash;</h5>

<p>Last night was very cold, and this morning there was ice on the lake,
and the bilge-water in the boat was frozen solid. Esau and Jens went up
the lake in the boat to stalk, and the Skipper accompanied them to fish,
while John fished nearer home.</p>

<p>About six o’clock the boat was seen returning loaded with the head
and skin of a very fine buck, and Esau gave us his history
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘As soon as we landed halfway up the lake we found the spoor of two
very large bucks and a smaller one which had swum across the lake in the
night. They seemed to have gone towards the Tyknings glacier, so we went
in that direction also. The wind was as bad as it could be in that
valley, for we were obliged to walk exactly with it at first instead of
against it, in order to get round a sufficiently large piece of country,
and then work back against the wind. We walked a couple of miles without
seeing anything, and at last got close to the Tyknings glacier and the
iceberg lake at its foot. You know that lake well enough, Skipper, full
of lumps of ice, some of them as big as this hut, which keep breaking
off from the projecting glacier as it slides down; and I dare say you
remember what an awful deathly stillness reigns there and what a dismal
sight the lake is, cold and black under the shade of the crags which
close in its sides.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page265" id = "page265">265</a></span>
<p>‘Well, we sat down there and used the glasses for a long
time&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by “using the glasses?”’ interrupted John;
‘drinking whisky and water?’</p>

<p>Esau withered him with a look and went on.</p>

<p>‘Well, “spied,” if you like, spied for a long time without seeing
anything; and we had just walked on again a few yards, when the silence
was suddenly broken by a cry from Jens of “Reins,” and there, 300 yards
in front of us, was a noble buck which had evidently been concealed from
our view by some rocks, and had now smelt us and was departing at a
stately trot, apparently despising undignified hurry.</p>

<p>‘I fancy his intention was to trot away at that long swinging pace,
and get into Asiatic Russia in time for tea; so I grabbed the rifle from
Jens, as of course, now that he was alarmed, a&nbsp;long shot was our
only chance; sat down on a stone, and with the faintest hopes of hitting
him, fired twice, and, of course, missed.</p>

<p>‘Now here was where my luck came in. If that buck had not been so
proud, he could have run straight away from us to the glacier beyond the
lake, but we were “betwixt the wind and his nobility,” and he wanted to
get a clean breeze, and run against it instead of down it. Consequently,
when he was about 350 yards away he turned to the right, apparently
intending to make a circle round us, and so get the wind in his
face.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page266" id = "page266">266</a></span>
<p>‘Directly he turned broadside to us Jens gave a shrill whistle, and
the buck stopped short for a moment, so that I had just time to make a
careful shot, and the bullet hit him in the ribs. At the shot he
stumbled, but recovered himself instantly, and made off a good deal
faster than before, evidently perceiving that things were getting
serious, and that “this here warn’t no child’s play.” Before I could
fire again he got into the ravine which runs down towards Rus Lake, and
was out of our sight.</p>

<p>‘We thought there was just a chance of cutting him off in that
extremely rough ground, though, of course, we could not tell whether he
was much hurt or not; so we ran as hard as we could for about a quarter
of a mile, loading as we ran. Suddenly I caught sight of him going very
slowly, but luckily he did not see us, so we dodged into a little gully,
and after another short run came in sight of him standing still, no
doubt owing to his wound, and about 250 yards away.</p>

<p>‘This time he saw us, and darted off as fleetly as ever, no longer
with his side to us, but straight away. I&nbsp;was dead beat, and Jens
had thrown himself down, and was panting
like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘A concertina?’ suggested the Skipper.</p>

DEATH OF THE ‘STOR BOCK’ AT THE ICEBERG LAKE, TYKNINGS HÖ.</p>

<p>‘Yes, just so. Anyhow, we could not run another yard; you know what
it is on those stones, so I sat down again, and with the rifle going
like a pump-handle, fired, and, by the greatest luck, hit him close
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page267" id = "page267">267</a></span>
to the tail, and the bullet went clean through his body and smashed his
shoulder. Down he went, and we raised a yell of triumph, whereupon he
jumped up again and went off at a slapping pace in a most extraordinary
manner. I&nbsp;believe if he could have reached the snow he would have
done us even now, but we were between him and the glacier, and he had
nothing but rocks to go on, bad enough for a deer with the proper
complement of legs and ribs, and very trying indeed to one crippled like
this, I’m sure.</p>

<p>‘However, he kept going at a great pace for a few hundred yards, and
we lay in a state of exhaustion and watched him through the glass. Soon
he began to move more slowly, and then to go round and round in a small
circle, and at last he lay down. By that time I had partially recovered
my wind, so I stalked him with great care and got within a hundred yards
of him, took a steady aim for his heart, and pulled. To my horror he
bounced up again, and ran like a hare for a dozen yards, and then rolled
over and over as dead as Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>‘How Jens and I whooped and shook hands and laughed can be imagined
by any one who has seen a grand deer almost escape him, and then, by a
bit of luck and a breakneck run, just nailed him when the chance seemed
hopeless. After that we lay on our backs and panted for some time, but
after finishing the whisky and a large portion of the iceberg lake
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page268" id = "page268">268</a></span>
we recovered sufficiently to skin our prize and cut him up. He is a most
splendidly fat “stor bock,” Jens says by far the best that has been
killed in these parts this year; a&nbsp;beautiful skin, and, best luck
of all, his horns have got rid of the velvet, and are fit to take home:
and they have fourteen points. I&nbsp;measured the fat on his loins, and
it was two and a half inches thick. Jens tried to bring home a hind
quarter as well as the head and skin, but before he had gone twenty
yards he found that it was too much for him, so turned back and buried
it with the rest.’</p>

<p>At this time of year the biggest bucks of a herd seem to separate
themselves from the rest and roam about, either alone or perhaps a
couple together. We think they act wisely in this respect, as the calves
are now old enough to run as fast as their mothers in case of danger,
and do not need any paternal protection; and the bucks would no doubt
become horribly bored if they remained with their wives and children all
the year round; whereas by this system they are quite independent for a
time, and roam all over the country, seeing a lot of life and living
uncommonly well. Very much like a married man, when he gets away on
board a friend’s yacht for a couple of months, and comes back quite
brightened up at the end of his trip, and positively agreeable and
good-tempered to his wife and family, insomuch that they are right glad
to see him home again.</p>

<p>Of course the stalker’s great object in life is to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page269" id = "page269">269</a></span>
shoot one of these big bucks; but it is a desire seldom realised, as
they are very restless, and only haunt the most secluded and difficult
country. We have only met with two others in this expedition, and those
the Skipper saw retiring at a good swinging trot over the heights of
Memurutungen.</p>

<p>We have obtained some interesting information from Jens about the
horns of the reindeer. As every one knows, both the bucks and does have
horns, but they shed them at different times: those of the does and
smaller bucks are now in velvet, and will not get properly hard until
October; they will then remain on all through the winter, and be shed in
the spring. But the large bucks have their horns hard now, and will shed
them in the winter, and so be defenceless during the time when the snow
lies thickest.</p>

<p>All this is undoubtedly true, for Jens is thoroughly trustworthy in
his facts, but what is the reason?</p>

<p>Jens does not know, but he gives us another fact. In the winter, when
the ‘stor bocks’ have no horns, the snow is often so deep that only the
strongest deer can scrape it away to lay bare the moss which at that
season forms their food. Then come the does and smaller bucks, and with
their horns push away the unfortunate big ones, and so are saved from
starvation, while the ill-treated ‘stor bocks’ have to work double tides
in order to get anything to eat.</p>

<p>We present this fact in all humility to Mr. Darwin as a solution of
the problem, ‘Why has the female
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page270" id = "page270">270</a></span>
reindeer horns?’ Evidently, they originally had none, but by constant
pushing at their lords and masters they developed them by degrees; then,
by the survival of the fittest, those does with the longest and sharpest
horns prospered most, and soon there were none of the hornless does
left, and all calves began to have horns as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Esau is inclined to the belief that, by the same line of reasoning,
the big bucks, constantly being shot at through untold ages, have
developed cast-iron ribs, and that that is the reason why they take such
a lot of killing.</p>

<p>Possibly we have worked the theory in the wrong direction. It may be
that originally all deer of every kind had horns, and the reindeer doe
is the only female which now keeps them, because she alone has to fight
for her living; but the snow and the horns together are cause and
effect, of that we are convinced.</p>

<p>The <i>pièce de résistance</i> at dinner was a ryper curry, executed
in the Skipper’s best manner, and worthy of a place amongst the old
masters, though providentially none of them were here to help us with
it. John also contributed his share to the menu, a&nbsp;roley-poley
pudding, which, when it came to table, looked a trifle doughy at the
ends, as even the best of such puddings generally&nbsp;do.</p>

<p>John turned to Esau, and in his sweetest manner said, ‘Do you like
end, old fellow?’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page271" id = "page271">271</a></span>
<p>He, a little astonished at this unwonted politeness, replied with
equal courtesy, ‘No, thank you, I&nbsp;don’t think I care about
end.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ said John, ‘well, the Skipper and I <i>do</i>;’ and thereupon
cut the pudding into two portions, and was giving one to the Skipper and
the other to himself, when the proceedings were interrupted by a brief
but energetic scene of riot and bloodshed, which was terminated by a
treaty of peace on the basis of the <i>status quo</i> as regards the
pudding, and subsequent re-division of the same into three parts by a
mixed commission.</p>

<p>Among the fish brought in to-day was one enormously long brute which
ought to have weighed five pounds, but was only three pounds. The
Skipper captured this prize at the outlet of the lake, which seems to be
a favourite place for sick and dying fish like this.</p>

<p>Matters of food are generally referred to Esau, because he cares more
about eating than the other two, as <i>they</i> say, or because he has
got more sense than they have, as <i>he</i> says. The two explanations
are probably identical.</p>

<p>When this fish was brought to him for judgment, he promptly said,
‘Give it to the men.’ The Skipper replied, ‘My dear chap, whenever we
collect any kind of food that isn’t quite nice, you always “give it to
the men.”’</p>

<p>Esau became grave at once, and answered ‘You
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page272" id = "page272">272</a></span>
forget we are not in England. At home, truly, we give the best of
everything to our servants, and are thankful for the worst ourselves;
but Norway is a country where the canker of civilisation has not yet
crept in to taint everything it passes over, and where the noisome worm
of increasing independence does not blossom in the heart of every tree.
Our men would be proud and happy to chew this aged fish, and we have had
instances to convince us that they would be prouder and happier if the
aged fish were nearly putrid.’</p>

<h5>September 10.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> Skipper caused great sorrow this
morning at breakfast by announcing his intention of leaving Rus Lake on
the day after to-morrow, which ought to be a Sunday, according to our
reckoning. It seems that his conscience upbraids him for leaving a
brother to be married without his assistance, and the House has sadly
approved his decision.</p>

<p>While Esau was having a great day with the trout in the river, the
Skipper went after deer, and came back cursing Fortune and all her
emissaries and signs, which means ravens, horseshoes, spiders, and so
forth. A&nbsp;few days ago, when he was starting on a stalk, he heard a
raven croaking overhead, so refrained from looking up lest he should
catch its eye, and have bad luck; but that raven was not to be balked of
his victim, and obtruded himself so that the Skipper <i>had</i> to see
him, and of course no deer came that day. The next day <i>two</i> ravens
crossed his path, both cawing in the loudest and most jubilant manner;
so he was greatly delighted, thinking that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page274" id = "page274">274</a></span>
this was a sure precursor of good sport; but something was wrong, and
again no deer resulted. But to-day two ravens came and cawed in a
gentle, soothing, confident manner just outside the window before we got
up: this gave the Skipper great belief in the turn of luck, and he
started with a rope in his pocket to tie up the deerskins withal, his
knife sharpened like a razor, and his bag full of cartridges. Once again
he saw nothing, and was nearly withered away by the cold wind and rain.
Coming home he picked up a horseshoe, probably the only one in the
Jotunfjeld; but the times are out of joint, and these barometers of
fortune have become depressed by the prevailing bad seasons and the
state of the weather, so that they cannot be depended&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>In spite of the absence of sport he came back raving about the
glorious views of the mountains, which quite repay any one for a long
walk now that they are newly covered with snow. From Nautgardstind
looking northwards, away from the glaciers, a&nbsp;splendid panorama is
spread out&mdash;hill, forest, and lake, lighted up by the bright gleams
of the September sun, still shining out bravely at intervals although
winter has begun. Down to the right is the hilly woodland country
through which we journeyed on our way hither, and on the left a vast
plain of rolling ground. Far beyond this rises a towering cluster of
high-peaked mountains, over whose heads float bands of fleecy clouds,
while up their weather-worn sides
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page275" id = "page275">275</a></span>
the cloud-shadows drift and seem to nestle in sleep. They say these
peaks are called Ronderne, but surely when seen on such a day,
‘a&nbsp;dream of heaven’ is a better name; for where else on earth can
man be so near heaven as in a lofty solitude like this, where he can
gaze his fill on nature’s most beautiful loneliness untouched and
undisturbed by human hand? Öla’s ignorance of English enables one to
gloat in silence over such a scene, without any danger of being rudely
recalled to earth by a jarring exclamation of ‘Ain’t it lovely?’ or
‘That’s about as good as they make ’em,&nbsp;eh?’</p>

<h5>September 11.&mdash;</h5>

<p>The Skipper made a last stalk, with his usual luck, not seeing even a
track, though he went into ground that we always considered a sure find,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page276" id = "page276">276</a></span>
near the west end of the lake. Near there, and under the shelter of the
curious sugar-loaf rock called Gloptind, there is a little ruined hut,
which was built by a former occupier of Rus Vand for greater convenience
in shooting near that part of the ground. When we were here before, Esau
was obliged to go home prematurely, and the Skipper and Jens went to
stay in this den after his departure, and got several deer while there.
This evening we persuaded the Skipper to tell us all about it, and after
he had put himself in what he considered a comfortable attitude on the
bed, and lighted his pipe, he began.</p>

<p>‘Well, when Esau went home, Jens and I were left up here, and got on
very comfortably considering the disadvantages under which the human
race has laboured ever since that unlucky business of the Tower of
Babel.’</p>

<p>‘What <i>does</i> he mean?’ whispered John anxiously to Esau.</p>

<p>‘How should <i>I</i> know?’ replied the latter. ‘Just listen a bit
longer, and I dare say we shall find out.’</p>

<p>The Skipper went on: ‘We went out several days, and walked enormous
distances without seeing any deer, so one day we decided to put a frying
pan, some firewood, and a change of clothes into the boat, and row up to
that little tumbledown stone hut at the other end for a night or two, as
it is in the heart of the most unfrequented country, and there is
nothing near to scare the most timid deer.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page277" id = "page277">277</a></span>
<p><ins class = "correction" title = "open quote invisible">‘We</ins>
packed everything into the boat and rowed off one fine morning, the
clouds, however, beginning to hang ominously over the distant mountains.
Jens rowed slowly, so that I could fish on the way, and our progress was
further delayed by a head-wind.</p>

<p>‘Very soon the clouds closed in all round, and the sky got very dark.
Jens kept rowing on steadily, from time to time looking up at the high
mountain ridges that wall in the west end of the lake, while I devoted
my attention to whipping the water from the stern, hoping to entice some
unwary fish before the approaching rain should stop our chance of
getting some fresh food. Suddenly he stopped rowing, and uttering the
magic word “Reins,” pointed up to an apparently deserted mountain slope
on the Bes Hö side, and handed me the glass, by the aid of which I soon
discovered two reindeer bucks feeding about a mile away, and almost
straight above&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>‘I had on a blue serge suit, so the first thing to be done was to
change to my stalking suit then and there in the boat; meanwhile the
threatened rain began to descend in torrents, and the wind swept by in
such squalls that Jens had to work hard to keep the boat in her place.
At last the change was completed, the serge suit stowed away under a
mackintosh, and we got to shore and began our stalk.</p>

<p>‘It was a difficult task to keep out of sight while advancing, and we
could only move at intervals when the deer shifted for a few moments
behind a rock
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page278" id = "page278">278</a></span>
or into a hollow in their search for food, so that we had first to run,
when opportunity offered, for a quarter of a mile over very bad ground,
then crawl another quarter over more broken ground; and at length, after
an hour of this, being pretty close to the deer, they happened to come
more into view, and we had to lie prone on our bellies for nearly twenty
minutes (while they fed their way into the next hollow); and the heavy
rain pelted down on us till we were soaked, sodden, and nearly perished
with cold.</p>

<p>‘I thought that time of cramped penance would never end, but at last
the hindermost buck got his head safe behind a welcome ridge, and then
we were soon up and after them.’</p>

<p>Here the Skipper stopped to strike a match on his trousers and
relight his pipe, and then resumed: ‘Now we knew we must be close to
them, and with rifles cocked, and hearts beating uncomfortably, advanced
expectant. I&nbsp;forgot to tell you that after Esau went home I allowed
Jens to take his rifle out, he was so desperately keen
about&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>‘Suddenly we came on the bucks only forty yards away, conscious of
danger, but not knowing what they feared; too unsettled to feed, too
uncertain to move.</p>

GOOD SPORT, BAD WEATHER. THE SKIPPER’S TWO ‘STOR BOCKS.’</p>

<p>‘I fired first, and immediately afterwards, as pre-arranged, Jens
fired, and both deer bounded into the air and disappeared like lightning
over a ridge beyond them. We followed at our best pace, I&nbsp;cramming
in a couple of cartridges as we ran, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page279" id = "page279">279</a></span>
saw them again directly, still running, and a good deal further away.
I&nbsp;fired two more shots, and one buck fell dead at once, while the
other galloped on about twenty yards further, and then suddenly stumbled
and fell head over heels.</p>

<p>‘I fancy that our first shots killed them, and that one was really
killed by Jens, but may I never know for certain! The yell that we gave
when we saw them both lying dead woke the echoes of that dreary
solitude, and must have been worth hearing by any student of human
nature: in a wild shout of triumph there is only one language for all
nations, and Jens and I joined our voices in the same glorious tongue
for once.</p>

<p>‘Both these deer were “stor bocks,” six years old and fat. We skinned
them there, and leaving the bodies as usual safe under stones, returned
to the boat with the heads and skins. By the way, John, you must have
seen the horns of these two deer on the wall of Besse Sæter, for I had
no means of getting them home, and Jens put them up there.</p>

<p>‘The day was drawing to a close when we reached the little stone hut
which was to be our lodging: its roof was full of holes, and let the
rain through like a sieve; but we stretched the two deerskins over it,
and so made it habitable for a time. Inside there is, as you know, only
just room for two men to lie side by side touching each other; and here,
after a liberal
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page280" id = "page280">280</a></span>
meal and a contemplative pipe, we turned in and slept like honest
men.</p>

<p>‘Next morning after breakfast, while I was making up a fresh cast for
my rod, I&nbsp;saw a man approaching the hut. As this was the only
intrusion from human beings that we had suffered for more than a month,
I&nbsp;was not a little surprised. Where the deuce could a man come
from? and what the dickens could he want? It soon proved to be old
Tronhūus with a note for Jens.</p>

<img src = "images/pic280.png" width = "510" height = "389"
alt = "The old stone Hut near Gloptind"></p>

<p>‘I must explain that Besse Sæter where Jens lives belongs to a man
who comes from Christiania, and Jens is only his tenant there. This man
had arrived at his sæter two days before this with a young English
nobleman, whom he was proud to have as his guest,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page281" id = "page281">281</a></span>
and to whom he naturally wished to show some sport; but he had been
unable to do so for want of a good stalker. This was of course very
unfortunate for him and his guest, but it by no means justified his
present conduct. He had addressed a letter to Jens, but written it in
English, so that I should read it, sending merely a verbal message to
Jens by his father, to ensure our both knowing the purport of the
letter, which was to the following effect:&mdash;“Jens. If you do not
return with the bearer of this letter to Besse Sæter to show myself and
Lord &mdash;&mdash; some deer, you will at once lose your tenancy of
Besse Sæter.” I&nbsp;could not keep Jens and thus cause him to be
unfairly ejected from his home, so having no paper with me, I&nbsp;wrote
in pencil on the back of the note that Peter had brought: “As you must
be aware that Jens is acting as my servant this summer, and that by
calling him away you leave me absolutely alone at the stone hut on Rus
Vand, I&nbsp;hope that you will not detain him after receiving this
note.”</p>

<p>‘With this missive Jens departed, and soon old Peter followed him,
and left me, like Robinson Crusoe, alone on my desert highland.
I&nbsp;am bound to say that I felt inclined to inquire with Selkirk,
“O&nbsp;solitude, where are the charms?” as I turned to perform the
duties of the day, absolutely deserted in that desolate spot, with no
companions but the lake and solemn mountain heights around me; so after
a short time I put the Lares and Penates&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">

<p>‘Hollo, what’s that?’ broke in Esau; ‘you never said anything about
bringing that with you before.’</p>

<p>‘You duffer!’ said the Skipper; ‘it’s Norwegian for the frying-pan
and tea-kettle: do you mean to say you’ve been all this time in the
country without learning that?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, all right,’ grunted Esau, ‘go on.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I put them into the boat and sculled the seven miles back to
this hut, as I did not feel inclined to remain alone in that little
stone hutch for the night.</p>

<p>‘Three days passed before they let Jens return to me; and during that
time I was certainly rather dull, and at night felt a trifle creepy, but
the days did not pass as slowly as you might have imagined; for being
without assistance my time was fully occupied in catching my daily
supply of fish, chopping firewood, cooking, washing, and so on. At night
the wind howled dismally round the cabin walls, but after the hard work
of the day I soon fell asleep, and at last began almost to like the
solitary life. Still I longed for Jens to come back, as I could not go
out stalking alone; the season was far advanced, and the weather very
cold.</p>

<p>‘How I cursed that Englishman’ (gentle murmurs of ‘Bet you did’ from
the other two) ‘as I cleaned out the tea-pot and scoured the frying-pan!
and how I pictured him to myself wandering with my faithful Jens over
the best reindeer-fjeld, and scaring away
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page283" id = "page283">283</a></span>
all the deer with his loud-sounding Bond Street express!’</p>

<p>‘I say, Skipper,’ put in Esau, ‘did <i>his</i> Bond Street express
make any more row than <i>yours</i>? because&nbsp;if&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘My dear fellow,’ said the Skipper, ‘you always put that kind of
expression into narrative; it’s Homeric; an educated man would be
pleased with&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>‘I was always expecting Jens; every sound, real or imaginary, caused
me to look up over the deserted lake, and hold my breath while I
listened to make out his voice in the distance; and when I went down the
river I heard his cheery shout in the rush of every rapid and the roar
of every fall.</p>

<p>‘After all it was only three days, and then one afternoon I found him
waiting for me at the hut. I&nbsp;was glad to see him&mdash;gladder than
I am to hear the dinner-bell at home, as glad as a bee is to get into
the open air after bunting its head against a window-pane for three
days’ (‘Beautiful simile!’ from John), ‘and especially glad to see how
pleased old Jens was to return to me again. I&nbsp;was also not
particularly sorry to hear that he had found a herd of deer and taken
Lord &mdash;&mdash; within shot; and the only result was a calf, which
Jens himself shot after the Englishman had missed.</p>

<p>‘After this I had a good time with grand fishing and more deer, but
we did not stay much longer at Rus Vand; as you know, I&nbsp;was back in
England by the end of September.’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page284" id = "page284">284</a></span>
<p>The story ended, we called the men in and had a great settlement of
wages and milk bills, and arranged how the Skipper’s baggage should be
transported tomorrow, and the rest next week.</p>

<p>Then we filled up glasses round with whisky and drank a solemn Skaal
(pronounced Skole) to every one, and then to Gammle Norgé, and finished
the evening with ‘Auld Lang Syne.’ It must have been a ludicrous sight
as we stood tightly packed in that tiny room, with heads all bent
towards the centre to avoid the rafters, our hands crossed in orthodox
fashion, and roaring at our highest respective pitches as much of the
words as we knew, while we swayed our arms up and down in the manner
essential to the proper rendering of the good old song.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page285" id = "page285">285</a></span>
<p>When the men cleared out, Esau produced a gorgeous counterpane which
he had commissioned Peter to buy in Vaage six weeks ago, and which the
old man brought over from Besse Sæter to-day. Its manufacture is
peculiar to this district; it is woven in most tasteful colours, red,
magenta, blue, and green being the most prominent, with a kind of
diamond pattern in white running diagonally across it; but, from the
‘What’s the next article?’ air with which Esau exhibited it, we began to
suspect that he was rather disappointed with it, and wanted to induce
some one to buy it. Suffice it to say that its introduction was received
with coldness.</p>

<p>This was a bad day for sport; we caught very little, and shot less.
We did spy a reindeer directly after breakfast, but as he was about six
miles away, close to the top of one of the highest mountains, and
running as if Loki were after him, no one cared about pursuing him.</p>

<p>John fishing in the lake managed to lose a ‘twa and saxpenny’ minnow,
trace, and twenty yards of reel line, and was quite discontented.</p>

<p>At night the wind had increased to a storm, and the clouds were right
down on the water, and hurrying past in endless wreathing drifts like
witches trooping to their nocturnal Sabbath.</p>

<span class = "subhead">NOT LOST, BUT GONE BEFORE.</span></h3>


<h5>September 12.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">Early</span> this morning we sorrowfully
packed the Skipper’s things on the pony, and then we three and Öla
marched off down the river towards civilisation. The Skipper hoped to
get over about twenty-five miles before night; Esau wanted to try the
river a long way down; and John said he ‘always liked a stroll on
Sunday,’ and with that object accompanied the Skipper for the first
eleven miles of his journey, returning to Rusvasoset in time for
dinner.</p>

<p>About four miles below Rus Lake, the river, which is there about
thirty yards wide, suddenly disappears into a narrow cleft in the rocky
bed, and runs in this curious rift for several hundred yards, and then
again emerges into daylight. The sides of this rocky prison are just
over a yard apart at the narrowest place, though the gap only appears to
be a few inches wide; but the force with which the immense body of water
is squeezed through the tortuous passage far down below, whirling huge
boulders along with irresistible force, and covering the surrounding
rocks with
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page287" id = "page287">287</a></span>
moisture from the ever-rising misty spray, makes it a severe trial to
the nerves to step across the cleft; the ceaseless din of the rushing
water is of itself sufficiently appalling.</p>

<p>This channel has evidently been gradually worn down through the solid
rock, which here appears to be a reef of softer nature than the usual
formation of this country. On the top and in niches all the way down are
still to be seen the turn holes caused by stones working round and round
in an eddy; but the curious fact is that while at the top the cleft is
only a yard across, it widens regularly out as it gets deeper, and at
the bottom is fully ten yards in width. Now it seems unlikely that the
Russen River could ever have been content to run in a bed so much
narrower than its present one, and from the appearance of the strata we
imagine that as it worked down and undermined the cliffs at each side,
they have gradually toppled forward to meet each other. Probably soon
they will actually touch, after which a very short time will see the
natural arch so formed covered with vegetation, and the river will run
in a subterranean passage.</p>

<p>Through this channel no fish could pass alive, so there Esau bade
‘farvel’ to the Skipper, and, encumbered with rod and fishing bag,
leaped like a goat across the intervening Devil’s Dyke, and was soon
lost to view as he fished his way up stream.</p>

<p>The other two pursued their journey steadily, and found it pleasant
to gradually walk down from the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page288" id = "page288">288</a></span>
Scotch mist which overhung everything up at Rus Vand, into, firstly,
dull dry weather just below the clouds, and then a little further into
real sunshine and warmth. About one o’clock they reached Hind Sæter, the
tenants of which were still there, but just in the act of removing to
the valley. Here they feasted together on fladbrod, and then the things
were packed on a cart, and the Skipper, following them as they jolted
away under Öla’s guidance through the pine forest, was seen no more by
his disconsolate comrade.</p>

<p>When John returned to Rusvasoset a little before dinner-time, we
found it necessary to bake bread and a pie, our invariable rule ‘when in
doubt.’ This was not a case that admitted of any hesitation, for the
Skipper had taken all the food that he could annex for his sustenance on
the journey, as he did not expect to find any people in the sæters on
his path.</p>

<p>The evening was spent in general tidying, and mending various
articles which had gone wrong; holes in landing-nets, rents in trousers
and coats, and inserting new screws in Esau’s boots for the stalk he
hoped, but hardly expected, to make on the morrow. At night the outlook
was anything but encouraging, dense clouds folding all nature in their
cold embrace, and the pitiless rain beating down on our poor little hut
as if it took a pleasure in the occupation.</p>

<h5>September 14.&mdash;</h5>

<p>We never knew when sunrise and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page289" id = "page289">289</a></span>
daybreak took place to-day, or whether they happened at all, for the
prospect was more hopeless than ever, and the rain still fell with
unabated vigour.</p>

<p>We were at the end of our indoor resources, but fortunately Öla
returned with some English papers which he had found waiting for us at
Ransværk, the sæter at which he and the Skipper passed the night, and at
which this bundle of literature had been deposited about a fortnight ago
by the latest traveller from Vaage. But for this, there would certainly
have been bloodshed in this remote spot, our tempers not being equal to
the strain of two days in succession without being able to see ten yards
in front of us, or to stir out without becoming water-logged.</p>

<p>Even the fish were apparently at last disgusted at not being able to
get into a dry corner by jumping out of the water, and our efforts to
persuade them to try the interior of a waterproof bag only met with
indifferent success.</p>

<p>The stubborn resistance of our well-tried roof has at last been
overcome, and soon after turning in last night we had to turn out again
to rig up various hydrostatic appliances with a view to diverting the
course of some of the superfluous rainfall, and irrigating the floor
therewith instead of letting the beds get it all. The latter really
needed it much less than the boards, which were somewhat dusty; but
probably the mistake arose from John sitting on one of them
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page290" id = "page290">290</a></span>
while he mixed the dough, so that it might have been taken for a
flour-bed.</p>

<h5>September 15.&mdash;</h5>

<p>At last we were relieved by a change in the wind, soon followed by a
cessation of rain, and then the mist began to lift, and by noon the sun
was actually beginning to glimmer feebly, and the mountains to be
visible for half their height.</p>

<img src = "images/pic290.png" width = "520" height = "397"
alt = "Rus Lake from the Western End: Nautgardstind in the Distance"></p>

<p>John went on a general tour of mountaineering and prospecting in
search of scenery, and came back delighted with himself, having made a
higher climb than usual, and seen Nautgardstind in all the perfect
beauty with which the newly fallen snow had endowed him.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that John does <i>not</i> like walking
uphill, and when he makes a self-sacrificing
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page291" id = "page291">291</a></span>
and voluntary ascent as he did to-day, he comes home brimming over with
an excess of conscious virtue which does not pass away until the genial
influence of a good meal and a pipe has reduced him to the level of all
humanity.</p>

<p>On his way home he heard a feeble squeak in a bush, and peering in
discovered a small animal which he at first took for a guinea-pig; but
soon, perceiving that it must be a lemming, his natural impulse was to
poke it with a stick. This was his first interview with one, though they
are common enough up here; and he is disposed to think them morose in
disposition; but really he ought to have recognised the fact that the
thin end of a walking-stick is not a means of intercourse at all likely
to arouse the sympathy of any animal, least of all that of a juvenile
lemming, who is obviously overcome with drowsiness, and wants to be let
alone.</p>

<p>The winter is now coming on apace, and already every fall of rain
down here is a snowstorm in the mountains, and every clear night means a
biting frost up there. Esau, scaling the heights of Bes Hö with Jens in
search of deer, found none on account of the mist, and in addition to
the danger of getting lost, a&nbsp;new peril was added by the snow. It
appeared that during the night a severe frost had immediately followed
the rain and coated everything with ice, then snow had fallen to the
depth of three inches, and on the top of that rain and sharp frost
again. The
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page292" id = "page292">292</a></span>
result was that at every step they broke through the crust of ice on the
top, and sank through the three inches of soft snow on to the lower
stratum of ice. This was all very well as long as they were on rough
ground; but the snow making every place look the same, in one instance
they got on to one of the steep little glaciers which are common on Bes
Hö, without knowing that they had done so: and suddenly Jens lost his
footing and began to slide downwards at a terrific speed. It seemed to
Esau that he would shoot straight down into Rus Vand, looking very blue
and cold three thousand feet below; but a friendly boulder intervened,
and by its assistance, and by spreading himself out like a gigantic
spider, he managed to arrest his wild career, and they got safe across
the treacherous glacier.</p>

<p>They had to cross another on their return, which was done with fear
and trembling; but although the difficulties of this kind of stalking
when unaccompanied by deer may seem to outnumber the pleasures, still
occasionally they were on fairly safe ground, and could get their hearts
out of their mouths for a few brief moments. At such times the splendid
view of all our old Gjendin mountains rising tier after tier behind each
other, a&nbsp;boundless sea of peaks and domes and jagged crags, all
robed in purest white, with the sun lighting up the virgin snow almost
too brightly for the eye to rest on; the keen frosty air; and the solemn
stillness, only broken now and again
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page293" id = "page293">293</a></span>
by the twittering of a flock of snow buntings, amply repaid them for the
arduous climb.</p>

<p>Then a few minutes of glorious excitement as, by the aid of
glissades, they shot down the steeps that it had needed hours of hard
labour to surmount, and they were back on the shores of Rus Vand, where
at present the snow had hardly begun to lie.</p>

alt = "Glissading home after a blank day"></p>

<p>In spite of the cold we had some first-rate fishing, and Esau caught
a trout which he asserted to be the very best fish for shape, condition,
and colour, that ever came out of Rus Lake, or anywhere else. Though not
as large as many we have caught, being only 2½ lbs., it certainly was a
beauty, and resembled the perfect fish that are occasionally seen in an
oil
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page294" id = "page294">294</a></span>
painting, but very seldom encountered in tangible, edible form.</p>

<p>The Rus trout, like those of Gjendin, are quite silvery, almost as
bright as a salmon, but with a few pink spots instead of black ones, and
uncommonly pretty they look when fresh out of the water.</p>

<p>Too soon evening put an end to our sport, and when the last rays of
the setting sun had tinted the distant snow with a delicate pink hue
which lingered, paled, and faded as the cold silvery light of the moon
began to assert its sway, the keen air drove us home, and made us
content to enjoy from the hut door the lovely clear night which
succeeded so bright a day.</p>

<p>Esau and Jens made a last laborious and fruitless stalk, trying not
only the whole Rus Valley, but crossing the mountains northwards into
Veodalen and traversing all the slopes of Glitretind, a&nbsp;most
splendid sight just now with his towering pyramid, 8,140 feet high. Such
a walk would have been
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page296" id = "page296">296</a></span>
impossible but for the snow, which had been reduced by the wind to the
consistence of hard sand, and made the going as good as it
could&nbsp;be.</p>

<p>Esau, who saw nothing all day, was a little annoyed on his return to
hear that John had wandered but a short distance up Nautgardstind to
gloat over the view, and there walked almost into a reindeer buck;
which, as John was armed with no more deadly weapon than a
double-barrelled field glass, had escaped uninjured. ’Twas ever
thus.</p>

<p>However, the mention of this buck opened on John’s devoted head the
floodgates of Esau’s memory, and he insisted on telling about his last
stalk here two years ago, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘By George! I shall never forget how Jens and I turned out that
morning across the same precipice that you passed to get up
Nautgardstind: we started pretty early because it was my last day, and I
had sworn to catch something or perish.</p>

<p>‘About ten o’clock we saw four deer, a fine buck and three does, on a
long narrow snow-drift on the east side of the mountain: they were about
a mile off and moving away, with the wind blowing straight from them to
us; so we went after them as fast as we could, without much attempt at
concealment at first.</p>

<p>‘Presently they left the snow and turned to the left, as if to skirt
round the mountain, we still following and getting rather nearer to
them. They seemed
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page297" id = "page297">297</a></span>
very restless and kept moving, and at last began to trot, and soon got
out of our sight.</p>

<p>‘We were half an hour without seeing them again, and at last Jens
discovered them far down below us in the large valley where you saw that
one to-day. The place where they were was quite unapproachable, but Jens
pointed out a sort of pass by which he thought it was likely they might
leave the valley, and so we went and hid ourselves in a convenient nook
fifty yards to the leeward of that place.</p>

<p>‘There we lay in a bitterly cold wind for an hour, and then the deer
began to come in our direction. Now was the critical moment: there were
two practicable routes in the pass; would they choose the nearer one,
which would give me a shot, or the other? They stopped a little time to
look for food, and provokingly grazed their way very slowly towards the
wrong one, and then all of a sudden seemed to make up their minds and
turned to the right one. The cold and cramp were forgotten as the deer
came within three hundred yards and were nearing us quickly, and, with
rifle cocked, I&nbsp;was already wondering whether the buck’s horns were
in velvet or not, and thinking what a splendid coat he had; when without
any warning a storm of sleet swept down upon us, and a dense mist
drifted over the mountain and shut out from our gaze the rocky pass and
deer alike wrapped in impenetrable gloom.</p>

<p>‘For fully half an hour this lasted, and then the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page298" id = "page298">298</a></span>
mist cleared as quickly as it had come, the sleet stopped, and the sun
shone out, making the ground fairly smoke: but, alas! the deer were
gone. We looked for their tracks, and found that they had actually
passed within forty yards of us during the storm; but our chance was
missed, and there was nothing for it but to renew the search.</p>

<p>‘Another hour of walking, and Jens’ quick eye caught sight of them,
this time high above our heads on some snow near the top of
Nautgardstind, and at last, thank goodness, lying down. There seemed to
be a possibility of getting to them, and we spent another hour crawling
like serpents in the attempt, only to find our way barred when we were
within four hundred yards by a ridge over which we could not pass
unseen.</p>

<p>‘However, from there we saw plainly that we could approach them by
going up the mountain, and then coming quite straight down above them,
with hardly any difficult ground to traverse. So we performed that weary
crawl back again, until we were safely out of sight, and then went up
Nautgardstind at a speed that has never been equalled.</p>

<p>‘Half an hour took us to the top, and then Jens made the only mistake
in a stalk that I ever saw: he got his bearings wrong somehow, and
thought that the deer were on one bit of snow, the top end of which we
could see, while I thought they were on another. Of course I had much
more confidence in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page299" id = "page299">299</a></span>
Jens’ opinion than in my own, but it turned out that he was wrong, and
in crawling to the place where he expected them to be, we unluckily came
into full view of the snow where they really were&mdash;a fact which was
made unpleasantly apparent to us by our suddenly catching sight of four
deer galloping down the drift two hundred yards away.</p>

<p>‘I took a careful aim at the buck, but fired too low, and the bullet
broke his fore-leg, which did not prevent him from following the does,
though at a reduced pace. Now I think our best chance would have been to
remain perfectly still, and trust to his stopping in time in some place
where I could get to him; but Jens was terribly excited, begging me to
shoot, and my own head was by no means as cool as it should have been,
so I sat on a rock and fired away all my remaining cartridges except
two, at the gradually receding form of the reindeer: I&nbsp;suppose at
the last shot he was five hundred yards away, and I don’t think I ever
hit him again.</p>

<p>‘Presently he got round the corner to the right, and into the next
valley, where a few days before I had killed two deer; and as I ran to
the right above him an astonishing sight met my gaze. The valley was
full of deer, about fifty altogether, in three distinct herds, and they
were all running about frightened by the firing, and not sure in which
direction it would be safe to&nbsp;go.</p>

<p>‘While we watched them from our peak a mile
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page300" id = "page300">300</a></span>
above, a&nbsp;buck and two does with a calf left the herd, and began to
come towards the very snowdrift on which the four deer were lying when
we made the fatal mistake. What became of the rest we never knew, nor
whither our wounded buck went; for when we saw this fresh four making
for the drift, it occurred to us to run towards the top and try to
intercept them if they should attempt to ascend the mountain on the
snow, as we expected they would.</p>

<p>‘Off we ran at top speed over terribly rough ground, and before we
got nearly in shot of the top of the long drift we saw the deer get on
to it at the bottom, and begin to gallop up with their untiring stride.
It was simply a race, with long odds on the Running Rein; and soon we
saw them standing at the top, while we were still over two hundred yards
from it. Then for the first time they saw us (for the drift was in a
ravine, and out of our sight as we ran), and they turned to flee, but
Jens somehow managed to find breath enough to whistle, and the deer
stopped for a moment.</p>

<p>‘I fired my last two cartridges, but in the condition to which I was
reduced by the run I could not have hit a haystack, and no damage was
done. So we turned homewards with deep and abiding sorrow in our hearts,
too despondent to look again for our wounded buck, or to see what became
of the other herds.</p>

<p>‘In those days I always took out seven cartridges,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page301" id = "page301">301</a></span>
which I fondly imagined to be a lucky number; but after this I solemnly
registered two vows: firstly, never to go out with so few again; and
secondly, never to shoot them all away at absurd distances in the
forlorn hope of killing a wounded deer.’ Esau here paused for a moment
or two, and then resumed: ‘By Jove, I&nbsp;did make myself agreeable to
the Skipper when I got home that night. I&nbsp;remember he
said&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>But John thought it was <i>his</i> turn to have a few weeks’
conversation, and rudely interrupted Esau’s reminiscences by calling his
attention to some writing which, like Belshazzar, he had detected on the
wall above his bed. It was in pencil, and seemed to have been written in
prehistoric times, for it was all illegible except the first two lines,
and even those required a great deal of deciphering by the aid of a
dripping candle, while Esau knelt on his bunk and flattened his nose
against the log wall, before he could read them. Then after licking the
tip of a pencil for a long time in meditative silence, he scrawled the
remainder of the poem underneath, so that the whole composition read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>A reindeer three miles off you spy,</p>
<p>And to shoot that reindeer you will try.</p>
<p>First a mile at the top of your speed you go,</p>

<p>Then a mile on your hands and knees you crawl,</p>

<h5>September 17.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">Our</span> ears were gladdened by the sound
of Ivar’s hoarse cachinnation some time during the night or early
morning, and on turning out he informed us that he should have been here
yesterday, but his cart had been smashed on the road beyond Hind Sæter:
however, he had patched it up and got it to the sæter; so we distributed
our goods on the two ponies, after seizing our last chance of a ‘square
meal,’ by eating an enormous breakfast of venison pie, cutlets, and
trout.</p>

<p>All our stores came to an end yesterday, except candles and soap. The
latter article has for some time been lying in great bars on a shelf as
a reproach to us, and we were glad to get it out of our sight to-day,
and ‘give it to the men,’ as we would anything else that is repulsive to
our feelings. There were a few scraps of other delicacies which we
divided among the retainers, and then taking with us a fore-quarter of
‘stor bock’ for our own consumption on the journey, and a hind-quarter
carefully sewn up in the sail of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page304" id = "page304">304</a></span>
Esau’s canoe, and intended as a present for Mr. Thomas, we regretfully
took leave of the little hut, and started for Besse Sæter.</p>

<p>Öla and Jens were sent down the Russen River, which is the nearest
way to Hind Sæter; and Ivar was to meet us at the eastern end of Sjödals
Lake as soon as he could get there.</p>

<p>We paused at the brow of the hill to have a last look at the
beautiful lake and quaint little huts, and to take off our hats to grand
old Nautgardstind, to whom we hoped we were not bidding an eternal
‘farvel;’ and then we turned across the fjeld, and, losing sight of the
Rus valley, were soon looking forward again to the change and
uncertainty of the homeward journey.</p>

<p>From Besse Sæter, which was reached at noon, we launched our craft
into the lake with a nasty side-wind blowing, which delayed our progress
considerably, so that we took an hour to reach the lower end of the
lake, a&nbsp;distance of not quite four miles.</p>

<p>There we found Ivar with his pony and sleigh, on which the canoe was
conveyed to the junction of the Sjoa and Russen Rivers, where Esau
launched her again and ran the rapids down to Ruslien Sæter, a&nbsp;very
fine bit of stream, in which the canoe could only just manage to
live.</p>

<p>Finding that the sæter girls were still here, we went in and asked
for milk. They suggested cream: amendment carried without a division.
A&nbsp;huge bowl
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page305" id = "page305">305</a></span>
of the thickest and most delicious cream was set before us, which we,
armed with two enormous spoons, attacked and soon consumed utterly, with
an indefinite amount of fladbrod and cheese. Charge for the whole,
sixpence! We have no hesitation in saying that the cream alone would
have been worth its weight in gold in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>We then regained our craft, and had a delightful cruise down to Hind
Sæter, the stream going at mill-race speed all the way, so that we did
the two and a half miles in fifteen minutes, arriving long before our
cavalcade of men and ponies, who started twenty minutes before us, while
we were discussing the cream.</p>

<p>The sæter was deserted for the winter, but Ivar produced his cart
from the bed of a stream where he had left it to improve the wheels, and
at half-past five we, with Jens and one cart, resumed our journey,
leaving the other two men with the canoe to follow&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>We had originally intended to make the journey to Lillehammer from
here entirely by canoe down the Sjoa until it joined the Laagen, but the
premature departure of the Skipper knocked that little scheme on the
head.</p>

<p>It would have been a tremendous enterprise, for the Sjoa is such a
turbulent river that there would have been a great deal of portage to be
done; but we had agreed to allow a fortnight for it, and were looking
forward to it with great delight. The Laagen is a fairly navigable river
all the way, with the exception
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page306" id = "page306">306</a></span>
of a few very large falls; but there is a good road by its side, so that
we should have had no difficulty if we had been lucky enough ever to
reach it. However,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>The best laid schemes o’ mice an’ men</p>
<p class = "indent2">Gang aft a-gley;</p>
</div>

<p>and we were reduced to the prosaic necessity of walking, and helping
to hold our luggage onto a jolting cart.</p>

<p>As we gradually descended into the birch-woods we were much struck by
the beautiful effects of the variegated autumn tints, and soon the
brilliant reds and yellows of the birches began to contrast with the
dark green of the fir trees, the light greyish green of the lichen, and
rich brown and purple of the ground and undergrowth. It was so long
since we had seen any trees, that their beauty seemed to come to us
quite as a new sensation.</p>

<p>Below Hind Sæter the road lay through dense forests of pines for mile
after mile, with hardly any change except where we got occasional
glimpses of the Sjoa tearing madly along far beneath us&mdash;so far
that only a faint murmur came up from the leaping, hurrying waters. Hour
after hour we walked, and still the same dark forest gloomed above us,
so remote from the busy haunts of men that it seems not to be worth any
one’s while to cut the trees except for use in the immediate
neighbourhood, and hundreds of them lie naked and dead as they have
fallen before
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page307" id = "page307">307</a></span>
the fury of the gale, and slowly rot or are devoured by insects until
their place is ready for a successor.</p>

<p>As the shades of evening began to close, we were several times
startled as the huge body of a capercailzie darted across the road at a
pace which seemed impossible to such an enormous bird, and with an
absence of noise that appeared equally unnatural.</p>

<p>About half-past eight we came to a more open part of the forest, and
soon we saw a glimmering light ahead: Jens cheerily said, ‘Ransværk;’
and in a few more minutes we pulled up at the door of a large sæter.</p>

<p>Without knocking Jens opened the door, and we walked in and struck a
light. There was the usual fireplace and table, and in the further
corner a bed, which, as we presently perceived, was occupied by two
girls. This discovery embarrassed us a little; but no one else, least of
all the girls themselves, appeared to be at all disconcerted.</p>

<p>In our favoured land a woman would probably be slightly concerned if
she were aroused from sleep by the unceremonious entrance into her room
of three men, two of them ruffianly-looking strangers of foreign
exterior; but not so these artless beings. The elder one at once got out
of bed and proceeded to dress, while her sister remained where she was
and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>When the dressing commenced, we, being innocent
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page308" id = "page308">308</a></span>
young bachelors, retired and remained outside till it was finished, but
we do not believe she appreciated our delicacy at all.</p>

<p>Then this poor girl, no doubt very tired after a hard day’s work at
cheese-making, proceeded to relight the fire, prepare coffee, and broil
some venison for us. And just as we finished a hearty meal, Öla and Ivar
arrived, so that she had to begin all over again for them. Finally, in
spite of our remonstrances, she dragged her sister out of the bed, and
insisted on our having it, while they went and slept in another building
a few yards away. So John took the bed they had vacated, while Esau made
a couch for himself in the cheese-room, and we slept the sleep of the
hard-worked, virtuous, penniless wanderer.</p>

<p>Verily they have a better idea in Norway of true hospitality than in
any other country under the sun.</p>

<h5>September 18.&mdash;</h5>

<p>How strange that our return to the haunts of men should be chiefly
marked by the sparseness of the fare provided for breakfast! A&nbsp;tin
of sardines took the place of the usual trout; and although Ransværk
consists of a group of several sæters, and almost attains to the dignity
of a village, and our quarters were in the largest and most imposing
mansion, there were no forks or spoons to be obtained, and we had to
fish our sardines out of their native oil with a Tollekniv, assisted by
a finger, and convey them to our mouths with the same implements.</p>

<p>After breakfast Esau and Jens turned out in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page309" id = "page309">309</a></span>
pursuit of capercailzie, which abound in the forest here; but though
they persevered until three o’clock, and got several shots, the annoying
birds all ‘went on,’ as an English keeper generally says when you ask,
‘Did you see if I killed that rabbit?’</p>

<p>Esau had used up all his large shot at ducks up at Gjendin, and his
cartridges were perfectly ineffectual at such a strong bird as the
capercailzie. Besides this, they are extremely wary, and always rise
about thirty yards from the shooter; they fly quite straight, and so are
very easy to hit; but though Esau knocked clouds of feathers out of them
at every shot, and did bring one to the ground which, from the closeness
of the underwood, could not be gathered, he was obliged to submit to
disappointment for once.</p>

<p>In one part of the forest they heard a raven shrieking angrily
(‘skriking,’ Jens called it, which has the same meaning in North country
dialect), and going to the place were in time to see a goshawk gliding
swiftly away with some victim in its grasp. In another place there were
a lot of squirrels, which Jens induced Esau to shoot for some purpose of
his own. What that purpose was we could only guess by seeing him gather
a bunch of beautiful wild currants and some flowers just before reaching
the sæter, and then brush his hair and march out with his bouquet,
berries, and squirrel-skins to some place unknown.</p>

<p>Soon after three o’clock we resumed our march,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page310" id = "page310">310</a></span>
and almost directly quitted the good Vaage road along which we travelled
last night, and took to a cow track on the right. The cart with the
canoe had a very rough time of it for the first five or six miles,
jolting and bumping in and out of holes, bogs, and ruts, and over
boulders and logs in a most appalling manner; then we had a piece of
decent road again, and at the finish another mile of rough track.</p>

<p>Soon after starting we passed the sæter where Jens lives when he is
not hunting in the mountains, and Esau wishing to see what kind of
snow-shoes they use in this part of the country, Jens ran up to the
house and fetched his ‘skier.’ To give an idea of the absurd honesty
which prevails here, we noticed that though Jens had been absent from
home for the last two months, and the windows were shuttered up, yet the
door was only latched; and after the inspection of the snow-shoes, Jens
would not trouble to take them back, but simply left them by the side of
the road, to wait his return three or four days hence.</p>

<p>Another instance illustrating the same simplicity occurred to us once
when travelling in quite a different part of Norway. When changing
carioles at a station our baggage was all heaped together on the
road-side, and as we wanted to stay there an hour or so for dinner, and
this was a main road with a fair amount of traffic, we suggested to the
landlord that our goods had better be brought inside the station.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page311" id = "page311">311</a></span>
He merely looked up at the sky with a weather-wise eye, and replied, ‘Oh
no, I’m sure it won’t rain.’</p>

<p>Our route to-day through the forest was most beautiful, at one time
descending to the level of the Sjoa, and even struggling along its bed
where the going on the bank seemed to be inferior, at another climbing
up and up and ever higher, until we stood on the summit of the range of
hills which confine this valley on the northern side. It is called
Hedalen, and is one of those strikingly beautiful half-cultivated
Norwegian dales which occupy the space between civilisation and the
untouched realms of nature.</p>

<p>This evening, the setting sun throwing a rich golden glow over the
scene, and lighting up the brilliant autumnal colours of the trees, gave
us an opportunity of seeing it quite at its best.</p>

<p>Gradually the forest began to get more open, and the road to improve.
Several peasants in picturesque garb were seen on the wayside: rough
buildings became more frequent, and fields and fences quite common; at
first only pasture land, but soon corn-fields and patches of
potatoes.</p>

<p>Then at last in the twilight we make a swift descent from the ridge
along which the road runs; a&nbsp;short plunge through a thicket, down a
grassy track; a&nbsp;bridge over a little stream; and as we breast the
opposite bank, a&nbsp;pile of buildings looming in front and looking
perfectly gigantic to our eyes, so long accustomed to the tiniest of
huts; and Jens points
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page312" id = "page312">312</a></span>
up, cracks his whip, and says, ‘Bjölstad.’ The pony boils up something
like ‘a&nbsp;trot for the avenue,’ and rattles the cart into a large
square courtyard, tenanted only by two huge dogs; and as a cheery old
Norseman rushes out in great excitement to welcome us and lead us into a
bright, clean, curtained room, we feel that we have said farewell to the
delights of savage life, and will probably have to put on a necktie
to-morrow.</p>

<p>Here we parted with our faithful Jens, and very sorry we were to do
so, as we think him a first-rate fellow: a&nbsp;man with a bright eye
and stolid demeanour; naturally silent, but game for anything;
a&nbsp;keen sportsman and wonderful stalker, and without a particle of
the laziness and sulkiness which characterised Öla.</p>

<p>Here, for the first time since leaving Lillehammer in July, we slept
between sheets.</p>

<p>Our own and only Ivar has volunteered to what he calls ‘transportare’
all our baggage in his cart down to Lillehammer, distant about eighty
miles hence, for the sum of twenty-two shillings. This sounds
unreasonable, but it was his own suggestion, so we did not argue the
point, only stipulating that he should be there by noon on Tuesday,
to-day being Saturday, and leaving the details to him.</p>

<p>Our thoughts were here recalled to the Skipper and his adventures by
finding the following note from him:&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page313" id = "page313">313</a></span>

<p>‘<span class = "smallcaps">Dear Esau</span>,&mdash;I have left behind
me here certain of what the Romans so appropriately called
“impedimenta,” and hope that you will be able to bring them home for me.
I&nbsp;got an old, old man with a small cart to bring my luggage down
from Ransværk. It was a wet day. I&nbsp;walked the first nine miles
while the old man and the rain were both driving. This ancient driveller
seemed to imagine it was a fine day, and had hung on his best coat and
hat, further aggravating his appearance with a spotted kerchief and a
light heart. He seemed remarkably cheerful, as carolling he drove his
<ins class = "correction" title =
"anomalous spelling unchanged: may be intentional">carjole</ins> and cajoled his horse through the dripping
pine forests. I&nbsp;arrived here at midday, and the owner, Ivar Tofte,
came out to meet me. He took a great fancy to me, and we finished
together a bottle of the most delicious aquavit, which he produced from
a cellar where it had been laid down in the time of the Vikings. It is a
pity neither of you can speak the language!</p>

<p class = "center">‘Yours haughtily,</p>

<p class = "right smallcaps">‘The Skipper.’</p>

<p>We found that the ‘impedimenta’ of which the Skipper had spoken were
147 loaded cartridges wrapped up in a flannel shirt, the whole being
enveloped in a partially cured reindeer-skin.</p>

<p>We were further reminded of our lost one by looking in the Day-book
(or traveller’s name-book), where his was the last English name. This
was not
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page314" id = "page314">314</a></span>
surprising, for though Bjölstad is a posting station, it is a very
out-of-the-way place; but we looked back for two years without finding
that any other Englishman had been here, and then the Skipper’s name
occurred again. Between these dates the names were all Norwegian, and
there were not very many even of them.</p>

<span class = "subhead">BJÖLSTAD.</span></h3>


<h5>Sunday, September 19.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">Bjölstad</span> is an ancient Norwegian
homestead, and consists of several separate buildings surrounding a
central rectangular court. The house that we slept in bears the date of
1818, and is the most modern as well as the largest of the group; it is
really a suite of state apartments for the use of the king on the rare
occasions when he visits this part of his dominions.</p>

<p>On the left-hand side of the courtyard as we stand at the door of our
state apartments, is a very quaint and picturesque old house with a
handsome porch, built in the Byzantine style, date 1743, and in this the
owner lives whenever he comes to this farm.</p>

<p>Opposite to us is another building even more curious in its
architecture, and considerably older than the other; and the remaining
side of the yard is occupied by another more modern edifice, used
chiefly as a storehouse. Besides these there are several other detached
outbuildings, in which sleighs, ploughs, spare cooking utensils, rugs,
and various other useful
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page316" id = "page316">316</a></span>
and useless articles are kept, including all the fittings and even the
weathercock of an ancient church which used to stand close to the farm,
but which is now demolished and partly reduced to firewood.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "pic316" id = "pic316">&nbsp;</a><br>
<img src = "images/pic316.png" width = "539" height = "420"
alt = "Old Buildings in the Courtyard at Bjölstad"></p>

<p>The owner of all this grandeur is one Ivar Tofte, a wealthy yeoman
who has several other farms in other parts of the country, one of which
is much larger and more important even than Bjölstad; and we were lucky
enough to find this Northern Crœsus at home, for it turned out that he
was the cheery old man in the shocking bad hat who had run out to
welcome us last night.</p>

<p>This morning he came into our room after breakfast, with a bottle of
aquavit in his hand wherewith to drink our health. Now to refuse this
ceremony is
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page317" id = "page317">317</a></span>
an unpardonable insult, but we had tasted aquavit before, and had a
wholesome dread of the nauseous compound, reeking of carraway seeds and
aniseed, which we were accustomed to expect out of an aquavit bottle. So
we poured out very small glasses, clinked them in approved manner, and
raised them to our lips as we uttered the magic word Skaal, more with a
feeling of disgust than any other sensation. And then it was beautiful
to see a heavenly smile steal over Esau’s ingenuous countenance; while
John, softly murmuring, ‘Chartreuse, by George!’ reached for the bottle,
and with a shout of ‘Skaal Ivar Tofte,’ proceeded to fill himself a
bumper. It was a perfect liqueur, soft, delicate, and mellow, as
probably age alone could have made it; and we drank Skaal to ‘Gammle
Norgé,’ and England, and Kong Oscar, and Queen Vict<i>oo</i>ria, and
Ivar Tofte again, and then ourselves again; whereupon the old man
perceived that we appreciated his ‘cuvée de réserve,’ and went for
another full bottle, which he left in our room, so that we could ‘put it
to our lips when we felt so dispoged.’</p>

<p>After this, John, feeling at once genial and liberal, announced his
intention of buying a <ins class = "norway" title =
"skinnfeld, now written -fell">sheenfelt</ins> (sheepskin rug) for importation into
England; and Tofte with an aged retainer volunteered to show us his
stores of sheepskins.</p>

<p>First our guide procured a bunch of enormous keys, such as Bluebeard
would have hanging from his
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page318" id = "page318">318</a></span>
waist in a pantomime, labelled ‘Key of the Wine-cellar. Umbrella stand.
Fowl-house. Potted shrimps. Cupboard where the jam’s kept,’ &amp;c.,
&amp;c. Then he marched off to one of the buildings, followed by us and
the other old man, whose profession was apparently to exalt Bjölstad
sheenfelts, and to debase&mdash;as far as extreme volubility and strict
inattention to the elements of truth would enable him to accomplish that
object&mdash;an ancient one which John wished to give in part
payment.</p>

<p>Bluebeard led us up some stairs to the Blue Chamber, where we saw
hanging in a row the skins, not of his deceased wives, but of many
‘timid-glancing, herbage-cropping, fleecy flocks,’ to use the beautiful
and touching language of the Greek poet. Then the two accomplices
selected the sheenfelt which they intended us to buy, and began to
expatiate on its beauties in terms of undisguised admiration; and after
half an hour’s huckstering and haggling, of course they persuaded John
to take that and no other. However, it was a beautiful specimen of this
kind of rug, of a dark grey colour, and very thick, warm, and heavy; so
both sides were highly satisfied, and proceeded to the drinking of more
aquavit in celebration of the bargain.</p>

<p>The weather was so unpleasant, and Bluebeard and his aquavit were so
engaging, that we decided not to leave here till to-morrow. Our host was
delighted to hear this, and at once went for more aquavit, which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page319" id = "page319">319</a></span>
he appears to consider the first necessity of life; and then he
proceeded to show us round his ancestral halls, as though he were a
sober old verger of Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>There was a sort of old-world Rip van Winkle sleepiness about
Bjölstad very soothing to men who like us have lived in the nineteenth
century for some few years. All the varlets and handmaidens were dressed
in the old native costume, so appropriate to the ancient wooden
buildings with quaintly carved eaves and doorways, about which they
hovered. In the courtyard were two enormous dogs, that barked loudly
whenever we appeared, but at the same time wagged their tails and looked
imbecile and good natured. There were also four geese, who meant to be
sitting basking in the rain, but as soon as anybody came to one of the
numerous doors, or crossed the yard, they all stood up and quacked
solemnly fourteen times each, then hissed once, and sat down again; and
as some one was always moving about the court, the quiet rest of those
birds was more anticipatory than real; but they alone of all the living
creatures at Bjölstad appeared to have any fixed employment which
demanded constant attention.</p>

<p>Bluebeard first took us through the state apartments, which contained
many curious and interesting things of all ages, from an axe nearly a
thousand years old, to a Birmingham plated teapot won at the Christiania
horse show in 1860.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page320" id = "page320">320</a></span>
<p>The Toftes boast themselves descended from Harald Haarfager, and are
so proud of their ancestry, that from time immemorial they have never
married out of their own family. If dear old Bluebeard may be accepted
as an ordinary result of this system, it must be confessed that it has
its advantages.</p>

<p>The things that he chiefly delighted to show us were those which had
been used by the king during his occasional visits, the most curious
being a large stone table made of one enormous slab not more than
three-quarters of an inch thick, but very hard and elastic, more like a
steel plate than stone; gorgeously embroidered counterpanes and chairs;
some very old ploughs and sleighs; and a brass-bound box with a
marvellous representation of Adam and Eve, very evidently before the
Fall, and the most remarkable thing in serpents which the wildest flight
of human imagination has yet conceived. There were some very nice silver
utensils and ornaments, but not many, as most of his plate is kept at
his largest farm. All that he had here was in a cupboard with a rubbishy
unlocked deal door, standing in John’s bedroom; a&nbsp;fact which speaks
volumes for the trusting simplicity and total inability to read a man’s
character from his appearance, caused by a millennium of marrying your
cousin once removed. Poor Bluebeard! he little thought what a viper he
was nurturing in his bosom, or rather in his chest (his plate
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page321" id = "page321">321</a></span>
chest), and that in that room lay one who could perhaps, if he would,
answer the questions&mdash;</p>

<p>Who took the Gainsborough?</p>

<p>Who has the Dudley diamonds?</p>

<p>Who stole the donkey? and</p>

<p>Where’s the cat?</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;John has now a large collection of ancient Norwegian
silver, counterpanes, belts, tankards, knives, and ornaments to dispose
of at very low prices if no questions are asked. &mdash;<span class =
"smallcaps">Advt.</span></p>

<h5>September 20.&mdash;</h5>

<p>We left Bjölstad in carioles on a real road about nine o’clock,
Bluebeard himself assisting in the operation of harnessing the ponies
and packing the baggage. Just as we were driving off, a&nbsp;brilliantly
original idea occurred to him, and he said, ‘Come in and taste my
aquavit.’ We did not like to refuse an old grey-haired man’s simple
request, so descended and drank another Skaal to all the usual loyal,
patriotic, and festive toasts, and then we drove off murmuring somewhat
indistinctly, ‘Shkaal Iva’ Tofte Shhkaal Iv Toffie Shko Toffy. Jolly
good fler-ole-shole-Toffy.’</p>

<p>All day we drove, and ever as we descended the Hedalen valley with
the noisy Sjoa on our right hand, the farming kept improving, and the
country becoming more populous; and we saw many families digging
potatoes, many pigs roaming free and unmolested as they do in Ireland,
and a few men bringing up stores from the town for the long season
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page322" id = "page322">322</a></span>
of snowed-up dreariness now so near at hand. Jens told us that in
winter, even so far to the south as Vaage, the sun only rises about
eleven, and sets at one o’clock, giving barely three hours of daylight
in midwinter; though he said that in the mountains where he spends his
time hunting, there is rather more light than in the valleys.</p>

<p>It may be well to explain in what manner so much information was
obtained from men whose language was unknown to us, and to whom ours was
equally incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The glorious principle of co-operation did it all. The Skipper spoke
Norse with great elegance and fluency, but did not understand it at all.
Esau could understand it perfectly, but was unable to express himself in
that tongue to even a limited extent; and John could neither speak nor
understand a word. Consequently our united accomplishments were equal to
meeting any emergency that might arise, even to the disentanglement of
such a coil&nbsp;as&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Brandforsikringsselskabet</i>, or&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sommermaandernepassagerbekvemmeligheder</i>,</p>

<p>or any other of the little complex words that an educated Norwegian
can construct. It is wonderful to hear the natives launch out into one
of these cataracts: they do it fearlessly, and steer through the whole
with unflagging fortitude, and very seldom with any fatal results.</p>

<p>The hay harvest seemed to be quite finished
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page323" id = "page323">323</a></span>
except on the roofs of the houses, where some people were still cutting
and carrying their crops. The barley had just been reaped, and was now
being dried by the process of impalement, a&nbsp;dozen sheaves, one
above the other, being transfixed by a pole stuck into the ground, just
as a naughty boy sticks a row of moths on a long pin, or as the
unfortunate Bulgarians were supposed to be exhibited during the
‘atrocity’ scare. Can it be possible that those stories arose from the
distant contemplation of a barley-field?</p>

<p class = "figfloat">

<img src = "images/pic323.png" width = "250" height = "494"
alt = "Barley Sheaves: A Norwegian ‘Atrocity’"></p>

<p>The Norwegians also dry their hay in a different manner from that
usually practised in England.
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page324" id = "page324">324</a></span>
They erect high hurdles made of larch poles in lines at intervals all
over the field, and on these they hang the hay to dry as we hang towels
on a horse, and it is by this means so well exposed to both air and sun
that it dries very quickly. No doubt the hurdles are also very useful in
spring as a shelter for the young lambs.</p>

<p>The weather kept improving so much that we grew quite jubilant, and
the ever-changing scenes that opened before us seemed full of life and
brightness, and we looked with a certain amount of pleasure on even the
magpies, which sat on the fences in scores, pluming their black-green
feathers, and talking things over quietly to themselves. So different
from the wary magpie of England, who, knowing that he is an Ishmael,
glories in the fact, and shrieks defiance to mankind at the top of his
voice and a tree.</p>

<p>For three hours we followed the brawling Sjoa through scenery that
would bear comparison with Switzerland, and then we reached the spot
where it joins the mighty Laagen, and crossing the latter by a
picturesque but discouraging bridge, soon struck the main road, and
pulled up for our first change of ponies at Storklevstad, nineteen miles
from Bjölstad.</p>

<p>At another place further on we found a shop kept by a Norwegian
Yankee, and entered it to buy some sugar-candy, wherewith to appease our
cariole-boy. This storekeeper informed us that the emigration from
Norway to the States was enormous just now,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page325" id = "page325">325</a></span>
especially to Minnesota and Wisconsin, and that no less than sixteen men
had gone this year from the little village of Vaage&mdash;a place which
does not strike one as being likely to contain that number of
able-bodied men at one time. Öla had told us that five of his brethren
were in Minnesota, but that he himself had no intention of leaving his
native country; and this we thought to be well, for if he were to join
them we are convinced that any enterprise in which they might be engaged
would inevitably fail with his invaluable co-operation and
assistance&mdash;unless perhaps the Skipper could be induced to go out
there and occasionally exhort him.</p>

<p>At Listad we lunched off a real white tablecloth; that is to say, we
ate not the cloth, but everything eatable that was placed
on&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>We also found a note from the Skipper asking us to bring along one or
two little things that he had been obliged to leave behind in his
hurried flight, just as the allied armies kept finding Napoleon’s
belongings at different places after Waterloo. The present loot
consisted of a coat, sleeping rug, and a towel.</p>

<p>At Kirkestuen we quitted the track for the night, having made fifty
miles in about ten hours. This, according to our experience, is a fair
rate of progression in Norway; in fact, the traveller is more likely to
find the average below this than above, unless he drives the good little
ponies faster than they like to go, which is wrong.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page326" id = "page326">326</a></span>
<p>Here the three women who kept the station were immensely amused
because we asked for coffee with our food, and one of them took upon
herself the task of rebuking us for such dissipated habits, and
explained at great length that no respectable people ever did such a
thing. ‘Coffee,’ she said, ‘should only be drunk during the day, gruel
after sunset.’ But we persisted in our reckless demand, and they finally
gave in, and produced the delicious compound that may be expected at any
wretched little dwelling throughout the country.</p>

<p>This was the first place where the papered rooms and iron stoves of
modern Norway obtruded themselves on our notice; but in spite of these
we were very comfortable, and think that Kirkestuen deserves all the
praise which we cannot find lavished upon it in any of the guide-books:
it is cheap, comfortable, and clean, and the food is excellent. If the
three young ladies who preside over its arrangements wish to send us any
little remuneration for this advertisement, we are agents for several
Central African Missions, to which we could hand it over; or, as ‘best
aquavit’ is a good deal appreciated by the missionaries themselves when
they are suffering from certain diseases peculiar to the Central African
climate, we would receive that liqueur in cases of not less than three
dozen in lieu of money.</p>

<h5>September 21.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> steadily improving weather of
our homeward journey is very pleasant, and already we are beginning to
almost forget those ‘Miseries in Cold and Grey’ which were so
conspicuous during our last few days at Rus Vand.</p>

<p>To-day we noticed that the whole population of the country appeared
to be engaged in the seductive pastime of potato-digging. One family
that we passed consisted of papa, mamma, and eight children of different
ages, all absorbed in this pursuit. The parents had gardening tools, the
elder children were using pickaxes and trowels, the younger ones
fire-shovels and wooden baking spades, and the mere babies were hard at
work with spoons and toasting-forks.</p>

<p>Here and there we detected a few people still making hay, presumably
because they had no potatoes. In Norway the hill-sides are so steep and
rocky that there is not overmuch room for the cultivation of grass, so
they have to collect it from every available
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page328" id = "page328">328</a></span>
corner where a few sprays of anything green can contrive to exist. As we
have mentioned, they are now curing grass on the house-tops, and to-day
we saw a man with a scythe about eighteen inches long, mowing in amongst
the stones on the river bank, and in some of the places where he went
the scythe blade was the only blade visible to the naked eye. One thing
seems certain, that a Norwegian <i>will</i> make hay while the sun
shines, even if he can only find rocks out of which to make&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>On this part of our journey we passed a great many spotted black and
white pigs: these pigs move with a greater dignity of bearing than the
ordinary white pig of Scandinavia, and altogether seem to consider
themselves superior to him, although they have not a curly tail.
Personally we think there is a certain subtle charm about the curly tail
of the white pig, a&nbsp;something that sets him off and renders him
more pleasing to the eye of the beholder than is a spotted pig with a
straight tail. However, our humble opinion does not seem at all to
affect the swagger of the spotted pig.</p>

<p>Near Formö we overtook a rosy-cheeked girl of about eighteen, astride
a bare-backed pony: the pony was seized with a spirit of emulation, and
insisted on accompanying the carioles for some distance in spite of her
efforts to stop&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The weather was now delightful; the roads were dry and dusty, and the
sun was so hot that the long
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page329" id = "page329">329</a></span>
cool shadows of the pine woods which at frequent intervals hedge in the
road were quite a welcome relief both to us and our shaggy steeds.</p>

<p>Ever as we followed the almost imperceptible descent of the road, the
great river Laagen became wider, deeper, and bluer, as it gathered
increased volume from the numberless tributaries which flow into it from
every hill, till at length at Fossegaarden it plunged over a series of
ledges in a splendid succession of falls, and after winding awhile amid
fir-clad islands and shaded grassy banks, it flowed into the Mjösen Lake
and was lost, while we on the road above, rounding the last corner and
turning to the east, soon found ourselves in Lillehammer, which really
looked quite a towny little town.</p>

<p>Esau stopped at Fossegaarden a couple of hours to throw a fly in the
tempting-looking water below the falls, and was rewarded at the first
cast by a rise from a fish whose peculiar wriggling and rolling soon
showed him to be a grayling; and before leaving, the bag was filled with
some very fine specimens of this beautiful and delicate fish.</p>

<p>We were greeted as old friends at the Victoria Hotel, where Ivar had
already arrived with our things. Then we ordered our own dinner, and
told the host to supply Ivar with whatever he wanted regardless of
expense (the result of this reckless munificence was a bill for nearly
two shillings); and in the happy frame of mind produced on both sides by
this course we
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page330" id = "page330">330</a></span>
settled our accounts with him, and giving him all our worn-out garments
and some candles and matches, we parted with the last of our
henchmen.</p>

<p>By the way, we here found a note from the Skipper asking us to bring
home a pair of shooting boots, three socks, and the remains of what had
apparently been a pocket handkerchief; but the obvious course that
suggested itself was ‘give ’em to the men,’ and we insisted on Ivar
taking these valuables.</p>

<h5>September 22.&mdash;</h5>

<p>With the utmost difficulty, by threats and coercion Esau was induced
to leave his bed, and dragged to the steamer in time for her departure,
as, if left to his own inclinations, he would have remained in his
insidious couch until this globe had performed its diurnal
revolution.</p>

<p>As it was, the ‘Skiblädner’ was indulging in a final premonitory
shriek before leaving the pier when we came hurrying and stumbling down
the hill at all paces, and we only stepped aboard just as she threw off
the last detaining rope.</p>

<p>The steamer was at first very empty, but more people joined us at
every stopping-place, of which there are about a dozen on the lake. Some
of these are little villages, with only the bright roofs and church
spire peeping out from among the fir trees; others no more than a
landing-stage projecting into the blue waters, and no other indications
of life save perhaps a couple of idle fishing boats and a flagstaff.</p>

<p>The morning was so calm and fine, that the grayling
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page331" id = "page331">331</a></span>
playing under the shore made the only break in the otherwise unruffled
surface of the lake, and it seemed strange to find ourselves back in
summer again, having left winter with its snow and frosts far above us
up at Rus Vand only a few days ago.</p>

<p>At Hamar some English people came aboard, so that we had some one to
talk to. At every place where the steamer stopped and fresh passengers
came off in boats to meet us, it seemed to be customary that they should
take off their hats to the captain on the bridge as they pulled up
alongside: even when we passed the smallest places without stopping,
merely throwing the mail bag into a boat as we darted by, the
fresh-water sailors on the steamer all took off their hats to the
fresh-water sailors ashore, the latter always returning the salutation;
and considering the fact that two steamers pass every day, this
indicates no small degree of politeness.</p>

<p>There is a great amount of character to be noticed among the natives
during a voyage on the lake, and although they are badly and even
grotesquely dressed (for the pretty old costume has quite disappeared in
this part of the country, and its modern substitute is hideous), still
their old-fashioned manners and simple courtesy are very striking; and
in spite of their love of a little mild ostentation they are so quiet
and well behaved, that they would appear to great advantage if
contrasted with the crowd that may be found say on a Greenwich
steamer.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page332" id = "page332">332</a></span>
<p>At Eidsvold we left the steamer for the train which was waiting to
receive us, and about nightfall were once more in Christiania, and after
a sumptuous supper went to rest in sumptuous beds, thinking ere we fell
asleep of how to-morrow we should again have to submit ourselves to the
yoke of civilisation, to discard our flannel shirts for linen ones and
stick-up collars, to throw aside our shooting boots, and again bite off
our nails, which have grown to their natural length under the soothing
influence of a long spell of unworried conscience.</p>

<h5>September 23.&mdash;</h5>

<p>We found Christiania this morning almost as hot as we left it, the
streets all dry and dusty, and the trees parched for want of rain; and
the sunshine was very pleasant as we wandered about the town into the
various shops, purchasing articles by the assistance of which we hoped
to attain popularity among our relatives on our arrival in England.</p>

<p>The shopkeepers were almost all very slow; in fact, the transaction
of any business is not the hardy Norseman’s strong point. We copy this
extract from the Skipper’s journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I went to the bank this morning to get some circular notes changed,
and they kept me there fussing over them for fifty minutes before I got
the money. During this time of expectation I read two letters from home
through, and had a chase after a torpid fly on the floor with my stick:
considering his languid condition this fly showed great spirit, but
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page333" id = "page333">333</a></span>
after following him about three feet along the floor and nine inches up
the wall, I&nbsp;made a fortunate dash at him, and concluded his
existence. Then I thought for a while and stared all round the room, and
cut my nails with my knife. Then I counted how many boards there were in
the floor, and how many nails there were on an average in each board,
and made a little calculation on these figures to discover how many
nails there were in the whole room, and what they weighed, how much they
cost, how many miles they would reach if laid end to end, and how many
men at how much an hour for how long it had taken to drive them all in.
Then again I thought for a while, but still the money did not come, and
my moral reflections on men and things had just led me to the conclusion
that all mortals were but desolate creatures, and that I of all men was
most desolate and abandoned, when at the end of forty minutes an
official arrived with a sort of cheque. And after that it took ten
minutes more to change the cheque into money in a lower room, where the
clerks had their hair so beautifully brushed and were so haughty, that
instead of being angry I could only thank them profusely for giving me
the money at all.’</p>

<p>After finishing our hunt for curios, it occurred to us that we ought
to see the vikings’ ship recently unearthed somewhere on the fjord, so
we walked down to the University, where we were told by a student that
it was not yet open to the public, but
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page334" id = "page334">334</a></span>
that if we would ask the Professor of Archæology, whom John profanely
designated ‘the boss that runs the antiquity show,’ he had no doubt
that, being strangers, we should be allowed to see the ship.</p>

<p>Would the fact of a man being a foreigner obtain his admission to a
private view of an English curiosity, save perhaps the plans and
mechanism of an iron-clad or torpedo? Probably not.</p>

<p>Revolving these thoughts within our minds we sought the professor,
and he at once left the work upon which he was engaged and took us to
the ship, which was locked up inside a wooden building that has been
erected for&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Very interesting it was, the preservation of the wood and also the
ironwork being wonderful. Unfortunately, some archæologists of earlier
date than the present had also made some excavations in search of
memorials of the past. They had cut a large hole in the side amidships,
for the purpose of carrying off the ornaments and other valuables by
which the dead viking was surrounded, in the chamber constructed for his
body right in the centre of the boat. The modern archæologists call
their predecessors ‘sacrilegious robbers,’ but we are averse to the use
of strong language among men of science.</p>

<p>However, the rest of the ship was perfect, even to the shields which
used to adorn the gunwale, which are now seen to have been made of thin
wood, and were probably only ornamental. She was a good big
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page335" id = "page335">335</a></span>
boat, rather flat-bottomed and low in the water, but with great breadth
of beam, and built on lines that left no room for doubt as to her
seagoing qualities.</p>

<p>The whole day was occupied by this shopping and sight-seeing, and we
went to bed more exhausted than by a hard day’s stalking at Gjendin, and
not half so much satisfied with our achievements.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to mention that we found at the hotel a note
from the Skipper, begging us to bring home a waterproof sheet and a few
clothes that he had been obliged to leave there. We think that this
young man must have shed nearly all his raiment before leaving Norway,
and gone home clad in a yellow ulster which we know he had left at the
hotel in July; for, judging from the fragments that we have picked up
from time to time on our homeward route, he cannot have much other
property with him except his gun, rifle, and fishing-gear.</p>

<h5>September 24.&mdash;</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">To</span>-day our Norwegian friends who
lent us the hut at Rus Vand came to dine with us, and then saw us safely
aboard the ‘Angelo,’ and at five o’clock, in the presence of an immense
crowd which covered the whole quay, some of the people cheering, but
many more weeping, we steamed out of the harbour.</p>

<p>As the sound of the last bell died away, and the last gangway fell
with a crash on to the landing-stage, a&nbsp;hatless, breathless man
rushed up the companion and darted at the spot where he supposed the
gangway to be: seeing that he was too late, he yelled to the people on
shore, and made as though he would have cast himself into the water, but
was restrained by the passengers. Meanwhile a fleet of little boats
endeavoured to catch a rope and be towed until he could be lowered into
one of them; but all failed, and the unfortunate man was carried off to
Christiansand, so that on his involuntary voyage he would have leisure
to meditate on the folly of a too prolonged farewell.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page337" id = "page337">337</a></span>
<p>With a gentle breeze we steamed down the fjord, which never looked
more lovely than on this evening; and so beautiful was the night, so
warm, so radiant, and with such a depth of glorious colouring from the
departed sun, that people crept away into the shade out of the
<i>moonlight</i>, from pure force of habit, after the heat of the
summer.</p>

<p>The influence of such a night, together with a certain sense of
something completed; the calm ocean all round us, and the soothing,
monotonous throbbing of the untiring screw, produced a longing for
confidence in John’s bosom, so that he gave utterance to his sentiments
as he leant with Esau over the rail of the hurricane deck, and watched
the ever-sparkling phosphorescent lights caused by the passage of the
vessel through the quiet water.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’m sorry to be leaving Norway, for, you know, there’s
something delightful to me about the simplicity of the people’ (Esau’s
mind reverted to Ivar Tofte and his plate cupboard); ‘they seem to place
a childlike confidence in a stranger, which is quite incomprehensible to
me. Then there is an unwordable calm, an indescribable tranquillity,
which seems to cling both to the country and its inhabitants; even the
houses seem to possess an imperturbable serenity of demeanour which you
will not find on any other island in Europe. In fact, y’know, Esau, it’s
a country where one might live quietly and die in peace, where “moths do
not corrupt, neither do worms
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page338" id = "page338">338</a></span>
break through and steal,” don’t you know, Esau? And I’m deuced sorry to
have to count among past memories the time we have spent here, where the
unbroken harmony of existence is that repose for which my soul has
longed these many years; but never until now, no, by George! never, has
it been able to discover the most uncertain tracings of its ideal.’</p>

<p>Here Esau, who had his deck shoes on, seeing what sort of a mood John
was in, stole away quietly towards the cabin, and left him prosing on to
the German Ocean. He paused, however, a&nbsp;moment before descending
the companion stairs, and caught a few more words which, as the moon had
now <ins class = "correction" title = "comma invisible">set,</ins> John
was confiding to the darkness.</p>

<p>‘A couple more days, and we shall be back in England, where, y’know,
I&nbsp;think civilisation is overdone. My existence there is a perpetual
state of toadying and being toadied: you see, it’s a place where the
serpent of social emulation creeps into our very beds, and hangs
suspended over our heads by a mere thread when we least expect him; and,
y’know, Esau&mdash;&mdash;’ But Esau had slunk down the stairs, and the
rest of this impassioned outburst is, we fear, lost to humanity.</p>

<h5>September 25.&mdash;</h5>

<p>We woke up to find ourselves just leaving Christiansand, and soon
reached the lighthouse at what the Skipper calls ‘the bottom
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page339" id = "page339">339</a></span>
left-hand corner of Norway,’ but remained in bed while we glared at it
through the port.</p>

<p>We were taking out a great number of emigrants for America, fine,
sturdy-looking young fellows, probably as hard as nails, and quite equal
to coping with the difficulties of a new country. They all looked so
cheery and full of hope and expectation, that we could not help thinking
rather sadly of the day when they will wake up to some of the unpleasant
realities of Yankee life, and wish themselves back again in their native
hills among their own simple-minded friends.</p>

<p>The day passed in the manner usual at sea when the water is smooth
and the ship goes merrily homeward bound. Hardly any one missed a
meal&mdash;rather a difference from the ordinary state of affairs in the
wild North Sea; and at evening the sun went down in a blaze of scarlet
and gold, which was reflected from the perfectly calm surface; and we
turned in with tranquil minds, even Esau being now reasonably hopeful of
seeing the Humber without suffering the pangs of starvation.</p>

<p>Esau is not a good sailor. On the last occasion of our return from
Norway he crossed by the ‘Angelo’ a&nbsp;fortnight before the Skipper;
and the latter, on arriving on board prepared for the voyage, saw the
steward, and asked him, ‘What sort of a passage did you have last trip,
George?’</p>

<p>‘Beautiful, sir. I never see a smoother sea.’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page340" id = "page340">340</a></span>
<p>Then the Skipper went on, ‘Did you see anything of Mr. Esau on the
voyage?’</p>

<p>To which George replied, ‘I seen him come aboard.’</p>

<p>And this brief remark of George’s conveyed a world of untold
fact.</p>

<h5>September 26.&mdash;</h5>

<p>We dropped anchor outside Hull at half-past five this evening, in the
remainder of the very same drizzling rain that was going on when we left
England in July.</p>

<p>Hull on Sunday in a soaking rain is not a place to grow romantic
about, so we omit all reference to our first sensations and maledictions
on our return to our native climate, and proceed to a more agreeable
subject&mdash;dinner.</p>

<p>It was a merry meal in company with four of our fellow-passengers,
who were likewise returning from sport in Norway&mdash;two from salmon
fishing, two from red-deer stalking, and with whom there was
consequently a bond of sympathy.</p>

<p>With these kindred spirits, after British beef had been washed down
with British beer, a&nbsp;Skaal drunk in British champagne, and tongues
were loosened by the confidential pipe and British cigar, we chatted
long and pleasantly; wandering again with rod and gun among the rugged
mountains of that wild north land, recalling exploits performed, and
perhaps indulging in those mild and harmless exaggerations of doughty
deeds which no traveller or sportsman can
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page341" id = "page341">341</a></span>
resist. Already we found ourselves forgetting the few disagreeable
incidents that occurred during our trip, and viewing everything through
that rosy mist which happily arises before all past hours of pleasure
and discomfort alike. Too soon bedtime put an end to our retrospect, and
we slept the sleep of the wearied traveller, with dreams of trout,
ryper, and reindeer&mdash;steamboat, cariole, and sleigh&mdash;mountain,
lake, and river&mdash;tent and sæter&mdash;paddle and
pony&mdash;hurrying through our brains in wild confusion.</p>

<p>To-morrow, alas! we commence again a life of gilded misery and gloomy
magnificence. Give to us the untrammelled freedom of ‘Gammle Norgé,’ and
the humble crust of fladbrod&mdash;&mdash;<i>with</i> JAM.</p>

THE JOTUNFJELD<br>
Showing various Routes to it.<br>
E. Weller <i>Lith.</i></p>


<div class = "endnote">
<h4><a name = "endnotes" id = "endnotes">Transcriber’s Notes</a></h4>

<p>Some names are written differently in the List of Illustrations than
elsewhere in the text.</p>

<h5>Phonetic spellings:</h5>

<div class = "hanging">
<p><span class = "serif">“Pandecāges”</span> with macron on second
<b>a</b>:<br>
the vowel is broad, as in “father”.</p>
<p><span class = "serif">“căno”</span> with breve over <b>a</b>:<br>
the speaker pronounced the word as “can” + “oh” (that is, neither the
Norwegian nor the correct English pronunciation).</p>
<p><span class = "serif">“Gammle Norgé” ... “Queen
Vict<i>oo</i>ria”</span><br>
both represent Norwegian pronunciation: final <b>e</b> is not silent,
and <b>o</b> is pronounced like “continental” <b>u</b>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Norwegian:</h4>

<p>Written Norwegian has three extra vowels: <b>æ</b>, <b>ø</b>,
<b>å</b>. At the time <i>Three in Norway</i> was published, the language
generally used Danish spelling. Many words written with <b>æ</b> would
now use simple <b>e</b>, and the letter <b>å</b> (pronounced like
“continental” <b>o</b>) was written <b>aa</b>.</p>

<p>The letter <b>ø</b> is equivalent to <b>ö</b> (“o umlaut”); the
correct letterform may have been unavailable to the printer.</p>

<p>The spelling “Ragnild” (expected form “Ragnhild”) is used
consistently. The forms “Bred Sjö”&nbsp;: “Bredsjö”, “skin tukt”&nbsp;:
“skintukt” (see Berries), and Jotun Fjeld&nbsp;: Jotunfjeld each
occur.</p>

<p>Double vowels representing a single long sound are rare except in a
few names; the macron on the first “u” in “Tronhūus” is redundant.</p>

<p>The inconsistent capitalization of “Ryper” : “ryper” is unchanged.
The plural form “ryper” is used throughout for both singular and
plural.</p>

<h5>Consistent o/ö (ø) errors:</h5>

<p>Öla (the name) <i>for</i> Ola</p>

<p>brod, fladbrod <i>for</i> brød, fladbrød</p>

<p>Formö, kröne, mölte bær, spör, Strömkarl <i>for</i> Formo, krone,
moltebær, spor, Stromkarl</p>

<p>Other uses of ö (ø) are correct: öl, öre, hö, sjö and any place
names.</p>


<h5>Words:</h5>

<p class = "serif">
Skoggaggany ... is merely the Norwegian for a scaup duck</p>

<p class = "inset">
one Norwegian translation says, in paraphrase, “we called it Skoggaggany
because we thought it sounded so Norwegian”. If the word is real, it
should end in <i>-and</i>, “duck”.</p>

<p class = "serif">
‘Ingen dyr, ingen fresk spör, ingen gammle spör,’ as the Norsk jäger
would remark</p>

<p class = "inset">
The spelling with ä for æ is anomalous. Modern Norwegian would have
“jeger”, though “jæger” is correct for the time. The spelling “spör” is
here an error for “spor” (tracks).</p>

<p>Other corrected forms are shown with <ins class = "norway" title =
"like this">popups</ins> in the body text.</p>

<h5>Berries (pgs. <a name = "berry_notes" id = "berry_notes" href =
"#berry_text">178-179</a>)</h5>

<p class = "serif">
Most of the berries of the country are now just at their best, and
Memurudalen is a grand valley for all of them, except of course the
strawberry and raspberry, which will not grow at this altitude. But we
have ‘<ins class = "norway" title = "krekling">klarkling</ins>’ (the
English crowberry) in great abundance; <ins class = "correction" title =
"(see below)">blau bær</ins> (wimberry), the finest and best ever seen,
in quantities; also ‘<ins class = "correction" title =
"(see below)">skin tukt</ins>,’ another blue berry rather larger than a
wimberry, and with a thicker skin and wonderful bloom on it; this we
think does not grow in England. Then less numerous are a berry <ins
class = "norway" title = "rips">something between</ins> a raspberry and
a red currant, but of better flavour than either of them; and the great
and glorious ‘<ins class = "norway" title =
"moltebær, also written ‘multebær’">mölte bær</ins>’ (cloudberry); to say nothing of ‘<ins class
= "correction" title = "(see below)">heste bær</ins>,’ and ‘<ins class =
"norway" title = "tyttebær">tutti bær</ins>,’ and several others of
unknown names. The last one grows in England, but we have forgotten <ins
class = "correction" title = "(see below)">its name</ins>; they make
jelly from it here, and prize it highly for its acid taste.</p>

<hr class = "mid">

<div class = "hanging">
<p><span class = "serif">blau bær</span><br>
<i>blåbær</i> (etymologically “blueberry”, but not the same as the
American blueberry)</p>

<p><span class = "serif">skin tukt</span><br>
probably <i>blokkebær</i>, also called <i>skinntryte</i></p>

<p><span class = "serif">heste bær</span><br>
possibly <i>heggebær</i></p>

<p><span class = "serif">“we have forgotten its name”</span><br>
English “lingonberry”, from its Swedish name <i>lingon</i></p>
</div>

<h5>Footnotes to Song (pgs. <a name = "song_notes" id = "song_notes"
href = "#song_text">196-97</a>)</h5>

<p class = "serif">4) ‘Brod,’ bread. The word does not rhyme to god,
being pronounced something like Broat, but it looks as if it rhymed.</p>

<p class = "inset">
The Norwegian word is “brød”. Here the writers almost seem to be talking
about the German equivalent “Brot”.</p>

<p class = "serif">8) ‘Stor,’ big, pronounced Stora before a
consonant.</p>

<p class = "inset">
The writers have misunderstood a rule. The word does vary between “stor”
and “store”, but the difference is grammatical, not phonetic.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
